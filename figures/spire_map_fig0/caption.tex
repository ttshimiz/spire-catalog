\label{fig:example_maps} SPIRE maps for all of the \herschel-BAT AGN (Here we only show a the first four in the sample. Figures for all of the sources are available online.) Each row is a separate AGN and each column is a separate waveband. Left: PSW or 250 \um. Middle: PMW or 350 \um. Right: PLW or 500 \um. All images have been smoothed for aesthetic purposes using a 2D Gaussian kernel with $\sigma=1.5$ pixels, slightly smaller than the beam size. Pixel intensity units are Jy/beam and colored using the \textit{cubehelix} colormap \citep{Green:2011sp} and arcsinh stretch. The range in intensity is from the maximum pixel value near the BAT position or 5 times the median global background (whichever is larger) to the median global background level measured during the aperture photometry process.  The white hatched circle in the lower left corner shows the FWHM of the beam for each waveband. The red cross plots the known position of the BAT AGN from Table~\ref{tbl:bat_info}.
