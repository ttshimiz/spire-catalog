\label{fig:example_maps} SPIRE maps for all of the \herschel-BAT AGN. Each row is a separate AGN and each column is a separate waveband. Left: PSW or 250 \um. Middle: PMW or 350 \um. Right: PLW or 500 \um. Pixel intensity units are Jy/beam and colored using the \textit{cubehelix} colormap \citep{Green:2011sp} and arcsinh stretch. The white circle in the lower left corner represents the FWHM of the beam for each waveband. The red cross shows the known position of the BAT AGN from Table 1.
