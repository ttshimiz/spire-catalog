\label{fig:excess_vs_agn} Relationships between $E_{\rm 500}$ and the hard X-ray luminosity (left), $L_{\rm 14-195\,keV}$, as a proxy for the intrinsic AGN strength, and $W1/W2$ (right), the ratio of the 3.4 and 4.6 \um{} flux densities, as a proxy for the relative strength of the AGN to host galaxy emission. In the right panel we also plot as a dashed line, the cutoff (0.86) for AGN-dominated galaxies prescribed by \citet{Stern:2012mz} after converting to flux densities. In both panels we removed sources with $E_{\rm 500} > 1.0$ that are associated with radio-loud AGN.
