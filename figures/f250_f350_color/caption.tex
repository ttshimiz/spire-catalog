\label{fig:hist_colors} \textit{top row:} KDE of the  $F_{250}/F_{350}$ (left) and  $F_{350}/F_{500}$ (right) colors for the BAT AGN (blue) and HRS (red). The solid lines represent the gaussian kernel density estimate of the distribution of colors for each sample. A K-S test indicates the $F_{250}/F_{350}$ color distribution for the two samples are statistically different with $P_{K-S} = 1 \times 10^{-4}$ while the $F_{350}/F_{500}$ colors are drawn from the same parent distribution similar ($P_{K-S} = 0.28$). \textit{bottom row:} KDEs for the colors of the BAT AGN separated into Sy 1s (blue) and Sy 2s (red). K-S tests indicate the two Seyfert types are drawn from the same parent population with $P_{K-S} = 0.2$ and $0.3$ for $F_{250}/F_{350}$ and $F_{350}/F_{500}$ respectively. In both rows we also plot the expected color for a modified blackbody with a dust temperature of 20 K and an emissivity of 2.0.
