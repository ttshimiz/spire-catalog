\label{fig:hist_250_350_color} KDE and histograms of the BAT AGN (red) and HRS (blue) $\,F_{250}/F_{350}$ (left) and  $\,F_{350}/F_{500}$ (right) colors. The solid lines represent the gaussian kernel density estimate of the distribution of colors for each sample. A K-S test indicates the $F_{250}/F_{350}$ color distribution for the two samples are statistically different with $P_{K-S} \ll 0.01$ while the $F_{350}/F_{500}$ colors are marginally similar ($P_{K-S} = 0.07$).
