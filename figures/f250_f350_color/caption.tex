\label{fig:hist_250_350_color} Histograms of the BAT AGN (red, solid line) and HRS (black, dashed line) $\,F_{250}/F_{350}$ (left) and  $\,F_{350}/F_{500}$ (right) colors. A K-S test indicates the $F_{250}/F_{350}$ color distribution for the two samples are statistically different with $P_{K-S} \ll 0.05$ while the $F_{350}/F_{500}$ are marginally similar ($P_{K-S} = 0.07$).
