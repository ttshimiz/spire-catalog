\label{fig:hist_250_350_color} KDE of the  $\,F_{250}/F_{350}$ (left) and  $\,F_{350}/F_{500}$ (right) colors for the BAT AGN (blue) and HRS (red). The solid lines represent the gaussian kernel density estimate of the distribution of colors for each sample. A K-S test indicates the $F_{250}/F_{350}$ color distribution for the two samples are statistically different with $P_{K-S} = 1 \times 10^{-4}$ while the $F_{350}/F_{500}$ colors are drawn from the same parent distribution similar ($P_{K-S} = 0.28$).
