\label{fig:example_photometry} An example of the segmentation image (left) and apertures used in the aperture photometry procedure. The solid white line indicates the target aperture whose size and shape were determined from the centroid and second order moments of the source (central light green group of pixels)  detected in the segmentation image. The dashed annulus shows the background annulus used to calculate the local background level. The dashed circular apertures are used to determine the background noise. The right image is the actual SPIRE map of the BAT source ESO 209-G012 using an arcsinh stretch. The red cross in both images shows the known location of ESO 209-G012 from Table 1.
