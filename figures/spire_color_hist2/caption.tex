\label{fig:color-color} SPIRE color-color plot of the BAT AGN (red stars) and HRS (blue circles). The magenta line and squares represent theoretical colors assuming a single greybody ($F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\beta}B(\nu, T)$) with emissivity, $\beta=2.0$. Each square represents a different temperature from 10 K (lower left) to 60 K (upper right). The yellow line and triangles are for $\beta=1.5$.
