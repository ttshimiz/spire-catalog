\label{fig:color-color} SPIRE color-color plot of the BAT AGN (green triangles) and HRS (blue circles). The red line and squares represent theoretical colors assuming a single greybody ($F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{\beta}B(\nu, T)$) with emissivity, $\beta=2.0$. Each square represents a different temperature from 10 K (lower left) to 60 K (upper right). The purple line and diamonds are for $\beta=1.5$.
