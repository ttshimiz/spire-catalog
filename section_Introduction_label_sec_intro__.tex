\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Dust fills the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies and plays an important part in the heating and cooling of the ISM and the general physics of the galaxy. While dust contributes very little to the overall mass of a galaxy ($<1\%$), the radiative output, mainly in the infrared regime, can constitute roughly half of the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy \citep{Hauser_2001, Boselli_2003, Dale:2007fk, Burgarella_2013}. Dust efficiently absorbs optical and UV emission and re-radiates it in the mid and far-infrared (MIR, FIR) depending on the temperature as well as grain size \citep{Draine:2003gd}.
