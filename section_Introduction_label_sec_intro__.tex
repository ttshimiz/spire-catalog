\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
Dust fills the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies and plays an important part in the heating and cooling of the ISM and the general physics of the galaxy. While dust contributes very little to the overall mass of a galaxy ($<1\%$), the radiative output, mainly in the infrared regime, can constitute roughly half of the bolometric luminosity of the entire galaxy \citep{Hauser_2001,Boselli_2003,Dale:2007fk,Burgarella_2013}. Dust efficiently absorbs optical and UV emission and re-radiates it in the mid and far-infrared (MIR, FIR) depending on the temperature as well as grain size \citep{Draine:2003gd}. Recently formed O and B stars produce the majority of the optical and UV light in galaxies, therefore measuring the total MIR and FIR light from dust provides insights into the current ($<100$ Myr) star formation rate (SFR) \citep[e.g.][]{Kennicutt:2012it}.

The SFR of galaxies sets the rate at which galaxies grow and evolve and is the one of the most important measures for understanding the hierarchical build-up of our universe over cosmic time. Large scale simulations, however, have shown that unregulated star formation leads to an overabundance of high mass galaxies \citep[e.g.][]{Croton:2006kx,Silk:2012fj}. Therefore some process must be able to stop, or ``quench,'' star formation before the galaxy grows to be too big. A leading theory for this quenching is energy input from active galactic nuclei (AGN), also known as feedback.

Nearly all massive galaxies harbor in their centers a supermassive black hole (SMBH), which grows through accretion of cold material during a phase where it is known as an AGN. The huge loss of gravitational energy of the cold material is converted into radiation that is evident across the whole electromagnetic spectrum and manifests itself as a bright point source in the nucleus of galaxies. The output energy from the AGN is can then be deposited into the ISM of its host galaxy through jets \cite[e.g.][]{Fabian:2003ek,Best:2007vn,Lanz:2015bq} or powerful outflows \citep[e.g][]{Alatalo:2011lk,Veilleux:2013qq,Harrison:2014xe,Tombesi:2015fj} that either heat the gas or remove it altogether.
