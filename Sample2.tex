We selected our sample of 313 AGN from the 58 month \swift/BAT Catalog \citep{Baumgartner:2012gf}, imposing a redshift cutoff of $z<0.05$. All different types of AGN were chosen only excluding Blazars/BL Lac objects which most likely introduce complicated beaming effects. In total the sample contains 94 Sy 1, 20 Sy 1.2, 1 Sy 1.4, 34 Sy 1.5, 9 Sy 1.8, 17 Sy 1.9, 129 Sy 2, 5 LINERs, and 4 AGN. For the purpose of broad classification, in the rest of this paper we choose to classify all Sy 1-1.5 as Seyfert 1's, and all Sy 1.8-2 as Seyfert 2's. In Table \ref{tbl_1} we list the entire \herschel{}-BAT sample along with positions and redshifts taken from the \href{http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/}{\textit{NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database} (NED)}. Luminosity distances for each AGN were calculated based on their redshift, except for those with $z < 0.01$ where we referred to the \href{http://edd.ifa.hawaii.edu/]}{\textit{Extragalactic Distance Database}}.
