\subsection{Timeline Fitting}\label{timeline}
Timeline fitting involves modeling the response of a point source in the Level 1 data as a two dimensional Gaussian and determining the best fit parameters for the Gaussian. The peak of the Gaussian then corresponds to the flux density of the source. Because this method is performed on the Level 1 data, instead of the image maps, it avoids any potential artifacts or biases involved with the mapmaking procedure and is the highly recommended procedure for determining the photometry of point sources by the \href{http://herschel.esac.esa.int/hcss-doc-11.0/index.jsp\#spire_drg:_start}{SPIRE Data Reduction Guide} (DRG, section 5.7.1).
