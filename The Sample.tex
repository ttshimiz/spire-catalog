\section{The \swift/BAT AGN Sample}\label{sample}
The  \swift/\textit{Burst Alert Telescope} (BAT) \citep{10.1007/s11214-005-5096-3,Gehrels:2004qf} operates in the 14--195 keV energy range, continuously monitoring the sky for gamma-ray bursts. This constant monitoring has also allowed for the most complete all-sky survey in the ultra-hard X-rays. To date, BAT has detected 1171 sources at  $>4.8\sigma$ significance corresponding to a sensitivity of $1.34\times10^{-11}$ ergs s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$\footnote{\url{https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/bs70mon/}}. Over 700 of those sources have been identified as a type of AGN (Seyfert, Blazar, QSO, etc.)
