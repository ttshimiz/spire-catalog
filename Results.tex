\section{Results}
Table 4 lists the SPIRE flux densities in Jy along with 1$\sigma$ uncertainties for the entire sample. We also make indicate sources that have a large contamination from galactic cirrus and whether the source was visually detected in the image or not. We decided to impose a strict 5$\sigma$ threshold for reporting the photometry. For all sources where $5 err_{\rm{tot}} > F_{\rm{bkg-sub}}$, only the 5$\sigma$ upper limit is given as the flux density for that band. Alongside the SPIRE photometry, we also list the 14--195 keV flux from the BAT catalog. Before investigating the scientific implications of the SPIRE flux densities for our sample, we ensured our measurements are consistent with those from other surveys and instruments.
