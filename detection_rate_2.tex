As we discuss in \citet{Melendez:2014yu} with the PACS photometry, this most likely is a result of the different redshift distribution between Sy 1's and Sy 2's. In the \textit{Swift}/BAT catalog, Sy 2's are found preferentially at lower redshifts than Sy 1's. Therefore, assuming Sy 1's and Sy 2's have identical luminosity distributions at the SPIRE wavelengths, more Sy 2's are expected to be detected compared to Sy 1's. As shown in Figure~\ref{lum_dist}, this is exactly the case. Sy 1's and Sy 2's do not show any difference in their luminosity distributions at the SPIRE wavelengths.
