As we discuss in \citet{Melendez:2014yu} with the PACS photometry, this most likely is a result of the different redshift distribution between Sy 1's and Sy 2's. In the \textit{Swift}/BAT catalog, Sy 2's are found preferentially at lower redshifts than Sy 1's. Without taking into account the redshifts, the higher detection rate for Sy 2's would indicate Sy 2's favoring higher FIR luminosities. However, as Figure~\ref{fig:lum_dist} shows, this is not the case. Sy 1's and Sy 2's have identical 250 \um{} luminosity distributions. At 350 and 500 \um{} the luminosity distributions for Sy 2's actually peak at a \textit{lower} luminosity than Sy 1's. Again, this is due to Sy 2's occurring at lower redshifts where it is easier to detect the lower luminosities at longer wavelengths.
