The mean and medians for Sy 1's and Sy 2's are very similar, with the mean only deviating by at most 0.3 dex and the median only deviating by at most 0.1 dex. We test for differences between the two samples using the Peto \& Prentice Generalized Wilcoxon test, which is similar to the standard Kolmogorov-Smirnov test but allows for censoring (i.e. upper limits). The test indicates that the probability that Sy 1's and Sy 2's are drawn from the same parent population is 11\%, 17\%, and 23\% for 250, 350, and 500 \um{} respectively. The usual cutoff for significant differences between two samples is 5\%, therefore we consider the luminosity distributions of Sy 1's and Sy 2's to be statistically the same at all of the SPIRE wavebands. Assuming all of the long wavelength emission is produced by cold dust, this shows that the dust mass in both Sy 1's and Sy 2's are similar.
