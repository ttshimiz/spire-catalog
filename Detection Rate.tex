\subsection{FIR Properties of the BAT Sample }
\subsubsection{Detection Rate}
\citet{Melendez:2014yu} in analyzing the PACS photometry found 95\% and 83\% of the BAT sample had a 5$\sigma$ detection at 70 and 160 \micron, indicating a largely complete survey of AGN for those wavelengths. Our SPIRE analysis finds a 5$\sigma$ completeness of 85\%, 69\%, and 46\% for 250, 350, and 500 \micron{} respectively. The decreasing completeness reflects both the decreasing sensitivity of SPIRE with increasing wavelength as well as the rapid fall-off in flux of the SED. Even with the relatively low detection rate at 500 \micron{}, this still results in 142 AGN having complete FIR SEDs, representing a great step forward in advancing the study of the dust content in AGN. 

After splitting the sample into Sy 1's and Sy 2's, we find a distinct difference in the detection rate (Figure~\ref{fig:det_frac}). Sy 2's, for all 3 wavebands, are detected at a significantly higher rate than Sy 1's (80\% vs. 90\% for 250 \micron, 60\% vs. 76\% for 350 \micron, 36\% vs. 55\% for 500 \micron).
