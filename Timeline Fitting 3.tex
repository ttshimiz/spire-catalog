Timeline fitting was used for 37 sources. All 37 were visually detected at 250 \um{}, 20 at 350 \um{}, and 14 at 500 \um. These sources are indicated in Table 2 with a ``TF". For the wavebands where the source was not visually detected, aperture photometry (described in the following Section \ref{aperture}) was used to measure the $5\sigma$ flux density upper limit.
