\section{\herschel{} SPIRE Observations and Data Reduction}\label{obs}
The Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) \citep{Griffin:2010sf} onboard the \herschel{} Space Observatory \citep{Pilbratt:2010rz} observed in small map mode 293 of our objects between operational days (OD) 722 and 1265 as part of a cycle 1 open time program (OT1\_rmushotz\_1, PI: Richard Mushotzky). 20 other objects with public data from other programs are also included to complete our sample. Within each observation from our program, two scans were performed at nearly orthogonal angles with the nominal 30" s$^{-1}$ scan speed that resulted in a $\sim$5' diameter area of homogeneous coverage in all three SPIRE wavebands centered at 250, 350, and 500 \um. Table 1 lists the proposal ID and observational ID for each source.
