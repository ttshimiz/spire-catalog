\subsection{Aperture Photometry}\label{aperture}
\subsubsection{Target and Background Apertures}
For the rest of the sources, we perform aperture photometry to measure the flux densities directly from the \textit{Scanamorphos}-produced SPIRE maps. The first step in aperture photometry is to determine the size and shape of the aperture from which to extract the flux from. SPIRE maps are also not absolute calibrated so it is necessary to use another aperture outside the source but local to determine the background level.

Instead of choosing apertures manually by visually inspecting each image, we used the Python based \texttt{Photutils} package
