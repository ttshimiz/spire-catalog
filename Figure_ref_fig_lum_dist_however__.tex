Figure~\ref{fig:lum_dist} however does not account for the undetected galaxies at each wavelength. For this, we use ``survival analysis'' to calculate the Kaplan--Meier product-limit estimator, a non-parametric representation of the survival function, $S(t) = P(T \geqq t)$. The Kaplan--Meier estimator then allows for an accurate estimate of mean, median, and standard deviation of a sample including censored values. Better tests can also be run in the comparison of two samples. 

To perform the survival analysis, we utilized the software package ASURV \citep{Feigelson:1985lr, Isobe:1990fk}. The only inputs necessary are the measured luminosities and upper limits for each wavelength. In Table~\ref{tab:mean_median_spire_lum} we outline the mean, 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of the luminosity distribution at each SPIRE wavelength. We give values for the entire sample as well as just the Sy 1's and Sy 2's.
