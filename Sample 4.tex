Numerous studies have been done on the BAT sample in the past that span nearly the entire electromagnetic spectrum. \citet{Weaver:2010rt} and \citet{Melendez:2008pd} used \textit{Spitzer}/IRS spectra to study the mid-infrared properties of the BAT AGN. \cite{Winter:2009kx} and \cite{Vasudevan:2013dz} studied the X-ray spectral properties for a subsample, while \citet{Koss:2011vn} looked at the optical host galaxy properties and \citep{Winter:2010yq} analyzed the optical spectra of the AGN themselves. Along with these, many of the BAT AGN are detected at radio wavelengths with the FIRST [REFERENCE] and NVSS [REFERENCE] survey as well. One key ingredient missing though is the far-infrared (FIR) where emission from ultraviolet-heated dust peaks.
