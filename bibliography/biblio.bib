  abstract = {We present the results of a homogeneous X-ray analysis for 82 nearby low-ionisation, narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) selected from the catalogue of Carrillo et al. (1999, Rev. Mex. Astron. Astrofis., 35, 187). All sources have available Chandra (68 sources) and/or XMM-Newton (55 sources) observations. This is the largest sample of LINERs with X-ray spectral data (60 out of the 82 objects), and it significantly improves our previous analysis based on Chandra data for 51 LINERs (Gonzalez-Martin et al. 2006b, A&A, 460, 45). It both increases the sample size and adds XMM-Newton data. New models permit the inclusion of double absorbers in the spectral fits. Nuclear X-ray morphology is inferred from the compactness of detected nuclear sources in the hard band (4.5-8.0 keV). Sixty per cent of the sample shows a compact nuclear source and are classified as active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates. The spectral analysis indicates that best fits involve a composite model: 1) absorbed primary continuum and 2) soft spectrum below 2 keV described by an absorbed scatterer and/or a thermal component. The resulting median spectral parameters and their standard deviations are <Gamma> = 2.11 $\pm$ 0.52, < kT> = 0.54 $\pm$ 0.30 keV, < log(NH1) >  = 21.32 $\pm$ 0.71 and < log(NH2)>  = 21.93 $\pm$ 1.36. We complement our X-ray results with an analysis of HST optical images and literature data on emission lines, radio compactness, and stellar population. After adding all these multiwavelength data, we conclude that evidence supports the AGN nature of their nuclear engine for 80% of the sample (66 out of 82 objects).

@article{Nemmen:2006kx,
  abstract = {We present a model for the accretion flow around the supermassive black hole in the LINER nucleus of NGC 1097 that fits the optical to X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED). The X-ray segment of the SED is based on observations with the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which are reported here for the first time. The inner part of the flow is modeled as a radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF), and the outer part as a standard thin disk. The value of the transition radius (rtr~225RS, where RS=2GM/c2) between the RIAF and the outer thin disk was obtained from our previous fitting of the double-peaked Balmer emission line profile, which originates in the thin disk. The black hole mass was inferred from measurements of the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy. When these parameters are used in the accretion flow model, the SED can be successfully reproduced, which shows that the line profile model and the accretion flow model are consistent with each other. A small remaining excess in the near-UV is accounted for by the contribution of an obscured starburst located within 9 pc from the nucleus, as we reported in an earlier paper. The radio flux is consistent with synchrotron emission of a relativistic jet modeled by means of the internal shock scenario. In an appendix we also analyze the Chandra X-ray observations of the ~1 kpc circumnuclear star-forming ring and of an ultraluminous compact X-ray source located outside the ring.},

@article{Ptak:2004fj,
  abstract = {We present the results of a 10 ks XMM-Newton observation of NGC 3998, a ``type I'' LINER galaxy (i.e., with significant broad Halpha emission). Our goal is to test the extent to which radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models and/or scaled-down active galactic nuclei (AGNs) models are consistent with the observed properties of NGC 3998. A power-law fit to the XMM-Newton spectra results in a power-law slope of Gamma=1.9 and 2-10 keV flux of 1.1×10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1, in excellent agreement with previous hard X-ray observations. The OM UV flux at 2120 {\AA} appears to be marginally resolved, with ~50% of the flux extended beyond 2. The nuclear component of the 2120 {\AA} flux is consistent with an extrapolation of the X-ray power law, although ~50% of the flux may be absorbed. The OM U flux lies significantly above the X-ray power-law extrapolation and contains a significant contribution from extragalactic emission. The upper limit for narrow Fe K emission derived from the XMM-Newton spectra is 33 eV (for Deltachi2=2.7). The upper limit for narrow Fe K emission derived from a combined fit of the XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX spectra is 25 eV, which is one of the strictest limits to date for any AGN. This significantly rules out Fe K emission, which is expected to be observed in typical Seyfert 1 galaxies. The X-ray flux of NGC 3998 has not been observed to vary significantly (at >30% level) within the X-ray observations, and only between observations at a level of ~50%, which is also in contrast to typical Seyfert 1 galaxies. The lack of any reflection features suggests that any optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk must be truncated, probably at a radius of order 100-300 (in Schwarzschild units). RIAF models fit the UV to X-ray spectral energy distribution of NGC 3998 reasonably well. In these models the mid-IR flux also constrains the emission from any outer thin disk component that might be present. The UV to X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) is also consistent with a Comptonized thin disk with a very low accretion rate (M<10-5MEdd), in which case the lack of Fe K emission may be due to an ionized accretion disk. Accretion models in general do not account for the observed radio flux of NGC 3998, and the radio flux may be due to a jet. Recent jet models may also be consistent with the nuclear fluxes of NGC 3998 in general, including the X-ray, optical/UV, and mid-IR bands. The (ground-based) near-IR to optical photometric data for the nuclear region of NGC 3998 contain large contributions from extranuclear emission. We also derive nuclear fluxes using archival Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 data, resulting in meaningful constraints to the nuclear SED of NGC 3998 in the optical band.},

@article{Lilly:2013pd,
  abstract = {A very simple physical model of galaxies is one in which the formation of stars is instantaneously regulated by the mass of gas in a reservoir with mass loss scaling with the star-formation rate (SFR). This model links together three different aspects of the evolving galaxy population: (1) the cosmic time evolution of the specific star-formation rate (sSFR) relative to the growth of halos, (2) the gas-phase metallicities across the galaxy population and over cosmic time, and (3) the ratio of the stellar to dark matter mass of halos. The gas regulator is defined by the gas consumption timescale (ε-1) and the mass loading lambda of the wind outflow lambda·SFR. The simplest regulator, in which ε and lambda are constant, sets the sSFR equal to exactly the specific accretion rate of the galaxy; more realistic situations lead to an sSFR that is perturbed from this precise relation. Because the gas consumption timescale is shorter than the timescale on which the system evolves, the metallicity Z is set primarily by the instantaneous operation of the regulator system rather than by the past history of the system. The metallicity of the gas reservoir depends on ε, lambda, and sSFR, and the regulator system therefore naturally produces a Z(m star, SFR) relation if ε and lambda depend on the stellar mass m star. Furthermore, this relation will be the same at all epochs unless the parameters ε and lambda themselves change with time. A so-called fundamental metallicity relation is naturally produced by these conditions. The overall mass-metallicity relation Z(m star) directly provides the fraction f star(m star) of incoming baryons that are being transformed into stars. The observed Z(m star) relation of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies implies a strong dependence of stellar mass on halo mass that reconciles the different faint-end slopes of the stellar and halo mass functions in standard LambdaCDM models. The observed relation also boosts the sSFR relative to the specific accretion rate and produces a different dependence on mass, both of which are observed. The derived Z(m star, SFR) relation for the regulator system is fit to published Z(m star, SFR) data for the SDSS galaxy population, yielding ε and lambda as functions of m star. The fitted ε is consistent with observed molecular gas-depletion timescales in galaxies (allowing for the extra atomic gas), while the fitted lambda is also reasonable. The gas-regulator model also successfully reproduces the Z(m star) metallicities of star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2. One consequence of this analysis is that it suggests that the m star-m halo relation is established by baryonic processes operating within galaxies, and that a significant fraction (40%) of baryons coming into the halos are being processed through the galaxies. This fraction may be more or less constant. The success of the gas-regulator model in simultaneously explaining many diverse observed relations over the 0 < z < 2 interval suggests that the evolution of galaxies is governed by simple physics that form the basis for this model.},

@article{Flohic:2006eu,
  abstract = {Using archival Chandra observations of 19 LINERs, we explore the X-ray properties of their inner kiloparsec to determine the origin of their nuclear X-ray emission, to investigate the presence of an AGN, and to identify the power source of the optical emission lines. The relative numbers of LINER types in our sample are similar to those in optical spectroscopic surveys. We find that diffuse, thermal emission is very common and is concentrated within the central few hundred parsecs. The average spectra of the hot gas in spiral and elliptical galaxies are very similar to those of normal galaxies. They can be fitted with a thermal plasma (kT~0.5 keV) plus a power-law (photon index of 1.3-1.5) model. There are on average three detected point sources in their inner kiloparsec with 1037 ergs s-1<L0.5-10keV<1040 ergs s-1. The average cumulative luminosity functions for sources in spiral and elliptical galaxies are identical to those of normal galaxies. In the innermost circle of 2.5 radius in each galaxy we find an AGN in 12 of the 19 galaxies. The AGNs contribute a median of 60% of the 0.5-10 keV luminosity of the central 2.5 region, and they have luminosities of 1037-1039 ergs s-1 (Eddington ratios of 10-8 to 10-5). The ionizing luminosity of the AGNs is not enough to power the observed optical emission lines in this particular sample. Thus, we suggest that the lines are powered either by the mechanical interaction of an AGN jet (or wind) with the circumnuclear gas or by stellar processes, such as photoionization by post-AGB stars from an old or intermediate-age population (in most cases) or by young stars (in a few cases).},

  abstract = {We present results from a high-resolution X-ray imaging study of nearby LINERs observed by ACIS on board Chandra. This study complements and extends previous X-ray studies of LINERs, focusing on the underexplored population of nearby dust-enshrouded infrared-bright LINERs. The sample consists of 15 IR-bright LINERs (LFIR/LB>3), with distances that range from 11 to 26 Mpc. Combining our sample with previous Chandra studies, we find that ~51% (28/55) of the LINERs display compact hard X-ray cores. The nuclear 2-10 keV luminosities of the galaxies in this expanded sample range from ~2×1038 to ~2×1044 ergs s-1. We find that the most extreme IR-faint LINERs are exclusively active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The fraction of LINERs containing AGNs appears to decrease with IR brightness and increase again at the highest values of LFIR/LB. We find that of the 24 LINERs showing compact nuclear hard X-ray cores in the expanded sample that were observed at Halpha wavelengths, only eight actually show evidence of a broad line. Similarly, of the 14 LINERs showing compact nuclear hard X-ray cores with corresponding radio observations, only eight display a compact flat spectrum radio core. These findings emphasize the need for high-resolution X-ray imaging observations in the study of IR-bright LINERs. Finally, we find an intriguing trend in the Eddington ratio versus LFIR and LFIR/LB for the AGN-LINERs in the expanded sample that extends over 7 orders of magnitude in L/LEdd. This correlation may imply a link between black hole growth, as measured by the Eddington ratio, and the star formation rate, as measured by the far-IR luminosity and IR-brightness ratio. If the far-IR luminosity is an indicator of the molecular gas content in our sample of LINERs, our results may further indicate that the mass accretion rate scales with the host galaxy's fuel supply. We discuss the potential implications of our results in the framework of black hole growth and AGN fueling in low-luminosity AGNs.},

@article{Terashima:2000yg,
  abstract = {We report X-ray fluxes in the 2-10 keV band from LINERs (low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions) and low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies obtained with the ASCA satellite. Observed X-ray luminosities are in the range between 4×1039 and 5×1041 ergs s-1, which are significantly smaller than that of the ``classical'' low-luminosity Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051. We found that X-ray luminosities in 2-10 keV of LINERs with broad Halpha emission in their optical spectra (LINER 1s) are proportional to their Halpha luminosities. This correlation strongly supports the hypothesis that the dominant ionizing source in LINER 1s is photoionization by hard photons from low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). On the other hand, the X-ray luminosities of most LINERs without broad Halpha emission (LINER 2s) in our sample are lower than LINER 1s at a given Halpha luminosity. The observed X-ray luminosities in these objects are insufficient to power their Halpha luminosities, suggesting that their primary ionizing source is other than an AGN, or that an AGN, if present, is obscured even at energies above 2 keV.},

  abstract = {We used Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph spectroscopic data on 426 galaxies including quasars, Seyferts, LINERs, and H II galaxies to investigate the relationship among the mid-IR emission lines. There is a tight linear correlation between the [Ne V]14.3 mum and 24.3 mum (97.1 eV) and the [O IV]25.9 mum (54.9 eV) high-ionization emission lines. The correlation also holds for these high-ionization emission lines and the [Ne III]15.56 mum (41 eV) emission line, although only for active galaxies. We used these correlations to calculate the [Ne III] excess due to star formation in Seyfert galaxies. We also estimated the [O IV] luminosity due to star formation in active galaxies and determined that it dominates the [O IV] emission only if the contribution of the active nucleus to the total luminosity is below 5%. We find that the active galactic nucleus dominates the [O IV] emission in most Seyfert galaxies, whereas star formation adequately explains the observed [O IV] emission in optically classified H II galaxies. Finally, we computed photoionization models to determine the physical conditions of the narrow-line region where these high-ionization lines originate. The estimated ionization parameter range is -2.8 < log U < -2.5 and the total hydrogen column density range is 20 < log n H (cm-2) < 21.  This work is based on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407.},

@article{Singh:2013fr,
  abstract = {Context. Galaxies, which often contain ionised gas, sometimes also exhibit a so-called low-ionisation nuclear emission line region (LINER). For 30 years, this was attributed to a central mass-accreting supermassive black hole (more commonly known as active galactic nucleus, AGN) of low luminosity, making LINER galaxies the largest AGN sub-population, which dominate in numbers over higher luminosity Seyfert galaxies and quasars. This, however, poses a serious problem. While the inferred energy balance is plausible, many LINERs clearly do not contain any other independent signatures of an AGN.  Aims: Using integral field spectroscopic data from the CALIFA survey, we compare the observed radial surface brightness profiles with what is expected from illumination by an AGN.  Methods: Essential for this analysis is a proper extraction of emission lines, especially weak lines, such as Balmer Hbeta lines, which are superposed on an absorption trough. To accomplish this, we use the GANDALF code, which simultaneously fits the underlying stellar continuum and emission lines.  Results: For 48 galaxies with LINER-like emission, we show that the radial emission-line surface brightness profiles are inconsistent with ionisation by a central point-source and hence cannot be due to an AGN alone.  Conclusions: The most probable explanation for the excess LINER-like emission is ionisation by evolved stars during the short but very hot and energetic phase known as post-AGB. This leads us to an entirely new interpretation. Post-AGB stars are ubiquitous and their ionising effect should be potentially observable in every galaxy with the gas present and with stars older than ~1 Gyr unless a stronger radiation field from young hot stars or an AGN outshines them. This means that galaxies with LINER-like emission are not a class defined by a property but rather by the absence of a property. It also explains why LINER emission is observed mostly in massive galaxies with old stars and little star formation.},

@article{Povic:2012ys,
  abstract = {Context. The connection between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies has been widely studied and found to be of great importance for providing answers to some fundamental questions related to AGN fuelling mechanisms, and both their formation and evolution.  Aims: Using X-ray data and one of the deepest broad-band optical data sets available, we study how morphology and colours are related to X-ray properties for sources at redshifts z <= 2.0, using a sample of 262 AGN in the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS).  Methods: We performed our morphological classification using the galSVM code, which is a new method that is particularly suited to dealing with high-redshift sources. Colour-magnitude diagrams were studied in relationship to redshift, morphology, X-ray obscuration, and X-ray-to-optical flux ratio. We analysed the different regions in the colour-magnitude diagrams, and searched for correlations with the observed properties of AGN populations using models of their formation and evolution.  Results: We confirm that a robust and reliable morphological classification of a general galaxy population at high redshift should be based on a multi-parametric approach. At least 50% of X-ray detected AGN at z <= 2.0 analysed in this work reside in spheroidal and bulge-dominated galaxies, while at least 18% have disk-dominated hosts. This suggests that different mechanisms may be responsible for triggering the nuclear activity. When analysing populations of X-ray detected AGN in both colour-magnitude and colour-stellar mass diagrams, the highest number of sources is found to reside in the green valley at redshifts ≈0.5-1.5. However, a larger number of low-luminosity AGN have been detected than in previous works owing to the substantial depth of the SXDS optical data. Whether AGN are hosted by early- or late-type galaxies, no clear relationship has been found with the optical colours (independently of redshift), as is typical of normal galaxies. Both early- and late-type AGN cover similar ranges of X-ray obscuration, for both unobscured and obscured sources.  Conclusions: Our findings appear to confirm some previous suggestions that X-ray selected AGN residing in the green valley represent a transitional population, quenching star formation by means of different AGN feedback mechanisms and evolving to red-sequence galaxies. They might be hosted by similar sources (the majority of sources being late-type elliptical and lenticular galaxies, and early-type spirals) with similar stellar populations, which are triggered mainly by major and/or minor mergers, and in some cases by means of secular mechanism, as shown in previous numerical simulations. In the aforementioned transition we observe different phases of AGN activity, with some AGN being in the QSO-mode detected as compact, blue, and unobscured in X-rays, and with others passing through different phases before and after the QSO-mode, being obscured and unobscured in X-rays, respectively.

@article{Treister:2012rt,
  abstract = {Using multiwavelength surveys of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) across a wide range of bolometric luminosities (1043 < L bol (erg s-1) <5 × 1046) and redshifts (0 < z < 3), we find a strong, redshift-independent correlation between the AGN luminosity and the fraction of host galaxies undergoing a major merger. That is, only the most luminous AGN phases are connected to major mergers, while less luminous AGNs appear to be driven by secular processes. Combining this trend with AGN luminosity functions to assess the overall cosmic growth of black holes, we find that ~50% by mass is associated with major mergers, while only 10% of AGNs by number, the most luminous, are connected to these violent events. Our results suggest that to reach the highest AGN luminosities---where the most massive black holes accreted the bulk of their mass---a major merger appears to be required. The luminosity dependence of the fraction of AGNs triggered by major mergers can successfully explain why the observed scatter in the M-sigma relation for elliptical galaxies is significantly lower than in spirals. The lack of a significant redshift dependence of the L bol-f merger relation suggests that downsizing, i.e., the general decline in AGN and star formation activity with decreasing redshift, is driven by a decline in the frequency of major mergers combined with a decrease in the availability of gas at lower redshifts.},

@article{Dubois:2013vn,
  abstract = {In order to understand the physical mechanisms at work during the formation of massive early-type galaxies, we performed six zoomed hydrodynamical cosmological simulations of haloes in the mass range 4.3 × 1012 <= Mvir <= 8.0 × 1013 M&sun; at z = 0, using the Adaptive Mesh Refinement code RAMSES. These simulations explore the role of active galactic nuclei (AGN), through jets powered by the accretion on to supermassive black holes on the formation of massive elliptical galaxies. In the absence of AGN feedback, large amounts of stars accumulate in the central galaxies to form overly massive, blue, compact and rotation-dominated galaxies. Powerful AGN jets transform the central galaxies into red extended and dispersion-dominated galaxies. This morphological transformation of disc galaxies into elliptical galaxies is driven by the efficient quenching of the in situ star formation due to AGN feedback, which transform these galaxies into systems built up by accretion. For galaxies mainly formed by accretion, the proportion of stars deposited farther away from the centre increases, and galaxies have larger sizes. The accretion is also directly responsible for randomizing the stellar orbits, increasing the amount of dispersion over rotation of stars as a function of time. Finally, we find that our galaxies simulated with AGN feedback better match the observed scaling laws, such as the size-mass, velocity dispersion-mass, Fundamental Plane relations and slope of the total density profiles at z ˜ 0, from dynamical and strong lensing constraints.},

Concentrating on the star-forming (SF) activity and dust contents, we derive parameters such as the specific star formation rate (sSFR), the dust luminosity, dust mass, and temperature. In our sample, 52% is composed of elliptical (E) galaxies and 48% of lenticular (S0) galaxies. We find a larger proportion of S0 galaxies among galaxies with a large sSFR and large specific dust emission. The stronger activity of S0 galaxies is confirmed by larger dust masses. We investigate the relative proportion of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and SF galaxies in our sample using spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey data and near-infrared selection techniques, and find a larger proportion of AGN-dominated galaxies in the S0 sample than the E one. This could corroborate a scenario where blue galaxies evolve into red ellipticals by passing through an S0 AGN active period while quenching its star formation. Finally, we find a good agreement comparing our estimates with color indicators.},

@article{Fabello:2011kx,
  abstract = {We use a stacking technique to measure the average H I content of a volume-limited sample of 1871 active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies from a parent sample of galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and GALEX imaging surveys with stellar masses greater than 1010 M&sun; and redshifts in the range 0.025 < z < 0.05. H I data are available from the Arecibo Legacy Fast ALFA (ALFALFA) survey. In previous work, we found that the H I gas fraction in galaxies correlates most strongly with the combination of optical/ultraviolet colour and stellar surface mass density. We therefore build a control sample of non-AGN matched to the AGN hosts in these two properties. We study trends in H I gas mass fraction (MH I/M*, where M* is the stellar mass) as a function of black hole accretion rate indicator L[O III]/MBH. We find no significant difference in H I content between AGN and control samples at all values of black hole accretion rate probed by the galaxies in our sample. This indicates that AGN do not influence the large-scale gaseous properties of galaxies in the local Universe. We have studied the variation in H I mass fraction with black hole accretion rate in the blue and red galaxy populations. In the blue population, the H I gas fraction is independent of accretion rate, indicating that accretion is not sensitive to the properties of the interstellar medium of the galaxy on large scales. However, in the red population accretion rate and gas fraction do correlate. The measured gas fractions in this population are not too different from the ones expected from a stellar mass-loss origin, implying that the fuel supply in the red AGN population could be a mixture of mass-loss from stars and gas present in discs.},

@article{Catinella:2010fj,
  abstract = {We introduce the GALEX Arecibo SDSS Survey (GASS), an on-going large programme that is gathering high quality HI-line spectra using the Arecibo radio telescope for an unbiased sample of ~1000 galaxies with stellar masses greater than 1010Msolar and redshifts 0.025 < z < 0.05, selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) imaging surveys. The galaxies are observed until detected or until a low gas mass fraction limit (1.5-5 per cent) is reached. This paper presents the first Data Release, consisting of ~20 per cent of the final GASS sample. We use this data set to explore the main scaling relations of the HI gas fraction with galaxy structure and NUV- r colour. A large fraction (~60 per cent) of the galaxies in our sample are detected in HI. Even at stellar masses above 1011Msolar, the detected fraction does not fall below ~40 per cent. We find that the atomic gas fraction MHI/M* decreases strongly with stellar mass, stellar surface mass density and NUV- r colour, but is only weakly correlated with the galaxy bulge-to-disc ratio (as measured by the concentration index of the r-band light). We also find that the fraction of galaxies with significant (more than a few per cent) HI decreases sharply above a characteristic stellar surface mass density of 108.5Msolarkpc-2. The fraction of gas-rich galaxies decreases much more smoothly with stellar mass. One of the key goals of GASS is to identify and quantify the incidence of galaxies that are transitioning between the blue, star-forming cloud and the red sequence of passively evolving galaxies. Likely transition candidates can be identified as outliers from the mean scaling relations between MHI/M* and other galaxy properties. We have fitted a plane to the two-dimensional relation between the HI mass fraction, stellar surface mass density and NUV- r colour. Interesting outliers from this plane include gas-rich red sequence galaxies that may be in the process of regrowing their discs, as well as blue, but gas-poor spirals.},

@article{Saintonge:2012uq,
  abstract = {Using atomic and molecular gas observations from the GASS and COLD GASS surveys and complementary optical/UV data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, we investigate the nature of the variations in the molecular gas depletion time observed across the local massive galaxy population. The large and unbiased COLD GASS sample allows us for the first time to statistically assess the relative importance of galaxy interactions, bar instabilities, morphologies, and the presence of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in regulating star formation efficiency. We find that both the H2 mass fraction and depletion time vary as a function of the distance of a galaxy from the main sequence traced by star-forming galaxies in the SFR-M * plane. The longest gas depletion times are found in below-main-sequence bulge-dominated galaxies (mu* >5 × 108 M &sun; kpc-2, C > 2.6) that are either gas-poor (M_{H_2}/M * <1.5%) or else on average less efficient by a factor of ~2 than disk-dominated galaxies at converting into stars any cold gas they may have. We find no link between the presence of AGNs and these long depletion times. In the regime where galaxies are disk-dominated and gas-rich, the galaxies undergoing mergers or showing signs of morphological disruptions have the shortest molecular gas depletion times, while those hosting strong stellar bars have only marginally higher global star formation efficiencies as compared to matched control samples. Our interpretation is that the molecular gas depletion time variations are caused by changes in the ratio between the gas mass traced by the CO(1-0) observations and the gas mass in high-density star-forming cores (as traced by observations of, e.g., HCN(1-0)). While interactions, mergers, and bar instabilities can locally increase pressure and raise the ratio of efficiently star-forming gas to CO-detected gas (therefore lowering the CO-based depletion time), massive bulges may prevent the formation of dense clumps by stabilizing gas disks against fragmentation, therefore producing the long depletion times. Building a sample representative of the local galaxy population with M * >1010 M &sun;, we derive a global Kennicutt-Schmidt star formation relation of slope 1.18 $\pm$ 0.24 and observe structure within the scatter around this relation, with galaxies having low (high) stellar mass surface densities lying systematically above (below) the mean relation, suggesting that \Sigma _H_2 is not the only parameter driving the global star formation ability of a galaxy.},

  abstract = {We study the relation between molecular gas and star formation in a volume-limited sample of 222 galaxies from the COLD GASS survey, with measurements of the CO(1-0) line from the IRAM 30-m telescope. The galaxies are at redshifts 0.025 < z < 0.05 and have stellar masses in the range 10.0 < log M*/M&sun; < 11.5. The IRAM measurements are complemented by deep Arecibo H I observations and homogeneous Sloan Digital Sky Survey and GALEX photometry. A reference sample that includes both ultraviolet (UV) and far-infrared data is used to calibrate our estimates of star formation rates from the seven optical/UV bands. The mean molecular gas depletion time-scale [?] for all the galaxies in our sample is 1 Gyr; however, ? increases by a factor of 6 from a value of ˜0.5 Gyr for galaxies with stellar masses of ˜1010 M&sun; to ˜3 Gyr for galaxies with masses of a few ×1011 M&sun;. In contrast, the atomic gas depletion time-scale remains constant at a value of around 3 Gyr. This implies that in high-mass galaxies, molecular and atomic gas depletion time-scales are comparable, but in low-mass galaxies, the molecular gas is being consumed much more quickly than the atomic gas. The strongest dependences of ? are on the stellar mass of the galaxy [parametrized as ?], and on the specific star formation rate (sSFR). A single ? versus sSFR relation is able to fit both 'normal' star-forming galaxies in our COLD GASS sample and more extreme starburst galaxies (luminous infrared galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies), which have ? yr. Normal galaxies at z = 1-2 are displaced with respect to the local galaxy population in the ? versus sSFR plane and have molecular gas depletion times that are a factor of 3-5 times longer at a given value of sSFR due to their significantly larger gas fractions.},

  abstract = {We are conducting COLD GASS, a legacy survey for molecular gas in nearby galaxies. Using the IRAM 30-m telescope, we measure the CO(1-0) line in a sample of ˜350 nearby (? Mpc), massive galaxies (log(M*/M&sun;) > 10.0). The sample is selected purely according to stellar mass, and therefore provides an unbiased view of molecular gas in these systems. By combining the IRAM data with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) photometry and spectroscopy, GALEX imaging and high-quality Arecibo H I data, we investigate the partition of condensed baryons between stars, atomic gas and molecular gas in 0.1-10L* galaxies. In this paper, we present CO luminosities and molecular hydrogen masses for the first 222 galaxies. The overall CO detection rate is 54 per cent, but our survey also uncovers the existence of sharp thresholds in galaxy structural parameters such as stellar mass surface density and concentration index, below which all galaxies have a measurable cold gas component but above which the detection rate of the CO line drops suddenly. The mean molecular gas fraction ? of the CO detections is 0.066 $\pm$ 0.039, and this fraction does not depend on stellar mass, but is a strong function of (NUV - r) colour. Through stacking, we set a firm upper limit of ? for red galaxies with NUV - r > 5.0. The average molecular-to-atomic hydrogen ratio in present-day galaxies is 0.3, with significant scatter from one galaxy to the next. The existence of strong detection thresholds in both the H I and CO lines suggests that 'quenching' processes have occurred in these systems. Intriguingly, atomic gas strongly dominates in the minority of galaxies with significant cold gas that lie above these thresholds. This suggests that some re-accretion of gas may still be possible following the quenching event.},

@article{Sanchez:2012fk,
  abstract = {The final product of galaxy evolution through cosmic time is the population of galaxies in the local universe. These galaxies are also those that can be studied in most detail, thus providing a stringent benchmark for our understanding of galaxy evolution. Through the huge success of spectroscopic single-fiber, statistical surveys of the Local Universe in the last decade, it has become clear, however, that an authoritative observational description of galaxies will involve measuring their spatially resolved properties over their full optical extent for a statistically significant sample. We present here the Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area (CALIFA) survey, which has been designed to provide a first step in this direction. We summarize the survey goals and design, including sample selection and observational strategy. We also showcase the data taken during the first observing runs (June/July 2010) and outline the reduction pipeline, quality control schemes and general characteristics of the reduced data. This survey is obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopic information of a diameter selected sample of ~600 galaxies in the Local Universe (0.005 < z < 0.03). CALIFA has been designed to allow the building of two-dimensional maps of the following quantities: (a) stellar populations: ages and metallicities; (b) ionized gas: distribution, excitation mechanism and chemical abundances; and (c) kinematic properties: both from stellar and ionized gas components. CALIFA uses the PPAK integral field unit (IFU), with a hexagonal field-of-view of ~1.3⎕', with a 100% covering factor by adopting a three-pointing dithering scheme. The optical wavelength range is covered from 3700 to 7000 {\AA}, using two overlapping setups (V500 and V1200), with different resolutions: R ~ 850 and R ~ 1650, respectively. CALIFA is a legacy survey, intended for the community. The reduced data will be released, once the quality has been guaranteed. The analyzed data fulfillthe expectations of the original observing proposal, on the basis of a set of quality checks and exploratory analysis: (i) the final datacubes reach a 3sigma limiting surface brightness depth of ~23.0 mag/arcsec2 for the V500 grating data (~22.8 mag/arcsec2 for V1200); (ii) about ~70% of the covered field-of-view is above this 3sigma limit; (iii) the data have a blue-to-red relative flux calibration within a few percent in most of the wavelength range; (iv) the absolute flux calibration is accurate within ~8%with respect to SDSS; (v) the measured spectral resolution is ~85 km s-1 for V1200 (~150 km s-1 for V500); (vi) the estimated accuracy of the wavelength calibration is ~5 km s-1 for the V1200 data (~10 km s-1 for the V500 data); (vii) the aperture matched CALIFA and SDSS spectra are qualitatively and quantitatively similar. Finally, we show that we are able to carry out all measurements indicated above, recovering the properties of the stellar populations, the ionized gas andthe kinematics of both components. The associated maps illustrate the spatial variation of these parameters across the field, reemphasizing the redshift dependence of single aperture spectroscopic measurements. We conclude from this first look at the data that CALIFA will be an important resource for archaeological studies of galaxies in the Local Universe.

@article{Cicone:2014ty,
  abstract = {We study the properties of massive, galactic-scale outflows of molecular gas and investigate their impact on galaxy evolution. We present new IRAM PdBI CO(1-0) observations of local ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and quasar-hosts: a clear signature of massive and energetic molecular outflows, extending on kpc scales, is found in the CO(1-0) kinematics of four out of seven sources, with measured outflow rates of several 100 M&sun; yr-1. We combine these new observations with data from the literature, and explore the nature and origin of massive molecular outflows within an extended sample of 19 local galaxies. We find that starburst-dominated galaxies have an outflow rate comparable to their star formation rate (SFR), or even higher by a factor of ~2-4, implying that starbursts can indeed be effective in removing cold gas from galaxies. Nevertheless, our results suggest that the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) can boost the outflow rate by a large factor, which is found to increase with the LAGN/Lbol ratio. The gas depletion time scales due to molecular outflows are anti-correlated with the presence and luminosity of an AGN in these galaxies, and range from a few hundred million years in starburst galaxies down to just a few million years in galaxies hosting powerful AGNs. In quasar hosts, the depletion time scales due to the outflow are much shorter than the depletion time scales due to star formation. We estimate the outflow kinetic power and find that, for galaxies hosting powerful AGNs, it corresponds to about 5% of the AGN luminosity, as expected by models of AGN feedback. Moreover, we find that momentum rates of about 20 LAGN/c are common among the AGN-dominated sources in our sample. For pure starburst galaxies, our data tentatively support models in which outflows are mostly momentum-driven by the radiation pressure from young stars onto dusty clouds. Overall, our results indicate that, although starbursts are effective in powering massive molecular outflows, the presence of an AGN may strongly enhance such outflows, and therefore have a profound feedback effect on the evolution of galaxies by efficiently removing fuel for star formation, hence quenching star formation.

@article{Combes:2013nr,
  abstract = {After new observations of 39 galaxies at z ~ 0.6-1.0 obtained at the IRAM 30-m telescope, we present our full CO line survey covering the redshift range 0.2 < z < 1. Our aim is to determine the driving factors accounting for the steep decline in the star formation rate during this epoch. We study both the gas fraction, defined as Mgas/(Mgas + Mstar), and the star formation efficiency (SFE) defined by the ratio between far-infrared luminosity and molecular gas mass (LFIR/M(H2)), i.e. a measure for the inverse of the gas depletion time. The sources are selected to be ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), with LFIR greater than 1012L&sun; and experiencing starbursts. When we adopt a standard ULIRG CO-to-H2 conversion factor, their molecular gas depletion time is less than 100 Myr. Our full survey has now filled the gap of CO observations in the 0.2 < z < 1 range covering almost half of cosmic history. The detection rate in the 0.6 < z < 1 interval is 38% (15 galaxies out of 39), compared to 60% for the 0.2 < z < 0.6 interval. The average CO luminosity is L'CO = 1.8 × 1010 Kkms-1 pc2, corresponding to an average H2 mass of 1.45 × 1010M&sun;. From observation of 7 galaxies in both CO(2-1) and CO(4-3), a high gas excitation has been derived; together with the dust mass estimation, this supports the choice of our low ULIRG conversion factor between CO luminosity and H2 for our sample sources. We find that both the gas fraction and the SFE significantly increase with redshift, by factors of 3 $\pm$ 1 from z = 0 to 1, and therefore both quantities play an important role and complement each other in cosmic star formation evolution.

@article{Boselli:2012qv,
  abstract = {We study the far infrared (60-500 mum) colours of late-type galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey, a K-band selected, volume limited sample of nearby galaxies. The far infrared colours are correlated with each other, with tighter correlations for the indices that are closer in wavelength. We also compare the different colour indices to various tracers of the physical properties of the target galaxies, such as the surface brightness of the ionising and non-ionising stellar radiation, the dust attenuation and the metallicity. The emission properties of the cold dust dominating the far infrared spectral domain are regulated by the properties of the interstellar radiation field. Consistent with that observed in nearby, resolved galaxies, our analysis shows that the ionising and the non-ionising stellar radiation, including that emitted by the most evolved, cold stars, both contribute to the heating of the cold dust component. This work also shows that metallicity is another key parameter characterising the cold dust emission of normal, late-type galaxies. A single modified black body with a grain emissivity index beta = 1.5 better fits the observed SPIRE flux density ratios S250/S350 vs. S350/S500 than beta = 2, although values of beta ~= 2 are possible in metal rich, high surface brightness galaxies. Values of beta ≲ 1.5 better represent metal poor, lowsurface brightness objects. This observational evidence provides strong constraints for dust emission models of normal, late type galaxies.

@article{Cortese:2012xy,
  abstract = {We combine new Herschel/SPIRE sub-millimeter observations with existing multiwavelength data to investigate the dust scaling relations of the Herschel Reference Survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of ~300 nearby galaxies in different environments. We show that the dust-to-stellar mass ratio anti-correlates with stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and NUV - r colour across the whole range of parameters covered by our sample. Moreover, the dust-to-stellar mass ratio decreases significantly when moving from late- to early-type galaxies. These scaling relations are similar to those observed for the Hi gas-fraction, supporting the idea that the cold dust is tightly coupled to the cold atomic gas component in the interstellar medium. We also find a weak increase of the dust-to-Hi mass ratio with stellar mass and colour but no trend is seen with stellar mass surface density. By comparing galaxies in different environments we show that, although these scaling relations are followed by both cluster and field galaxies, Hi-deficient systems have, at fixed stellar mass, stellar mass surface density and morphological type systematically lower dust-to-stellar mass and higher dust-to-Hi mass ratios than Hi-normal/field galaxies. This provides clear evidence that dust is removed from the star-forming disk of cluster galaxies but the effect of the environment is less strong than what is observed in the case of the Hi disk. Such effects naturally arise if the dust disk is less extended than the Hi and follows more closely the distribution of the molecular gas phase, i.e., if the dust-to-atomic gas ratio monotonically decreases with distance from the galactic center.

  abstract = {By combining Herschel-SPIRE observations obtained as part of the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey with 21 cm Hi data from the literature, we investigate the role of the cluster environment on the dust content of Virgo spiral galaxies. We show for the first time that the extent of the dust disk is significantly reduced in Hi-deficient galaxies, following remarkably well the observed ``truncation'' of the Hi disk. The ratio of the submillimetre-to-optical diameter correlates with the Hi-deficiency, suggesting that the cluster environment is able to strip dust as well as gas. These results provide important insights not only into the evolution of cluster galaxies but also into the metal enrichment of the intra-cluster medium.

  abstract = {We present a new method for studying the star formation history of late-type cluster galaxies undergoing gas starvation or a ram pressure stripping event by combining bidimensional multifrequency observations with multizone models of galactic chemical and spectrophotometric evolution. This method is applied to the Virgo Cluster anemic galaxy NGC 4569. We extract radial profiles from recently obtained UV GALEX images at 1530 and 2310 {\AA}, from visible and near-IR narrow (Halpha) and broadband images at different wavelengths (u, B, g, V, r, i, z, J, H, and K), from Spitzer IRAC and MIPS images, and from atomic and molecular gas maps. The model in the absence of interaction (characterized by its rotation velocity and spin parameter) is constrained by the unperturbed H-band light profile and by the Halpha rotation curve. We can reconstruct the observed total gas radial density profile and the light surface brightness profiles at all wavelengths in a ram pressure stripping scenario by making simple assumptions about the gas removal process and the orbit of NGC 4569 inside the cluster. The observed profiles cannot be reproduced by simply stopping gas infall, thus mimicking starvation. Gas removal is required, which is more efficient in the outer disk, inducing radial quenching in the star formation activity, as observed and reproduced by the model. This observational result, consistent with theoretical predictions that a galaxy cluster-IGM interaction is able to modify structural disk parameters without gravitational perturbations, is discussed in the framework of the origin of lenticular galaxies in clusters.},

@article{Melendez:2014yu,
  abstract = {Far-Infrared (FIR) photometry from the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer on the Herschel Space Observatory is presented for 313 nearby, hard X-ray selected galaxies from the 58 month Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) Active Galactic Nuclei catalog. The present data do not distinguish between the FIR luminosity distributions at 70 and 160 mum for Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies. This result suggests that if the FIR emission is from the nuclear obscuring material surrounding the accretion disk, then it emits isotropically, independent of orientation. Alternatively, a significant fraction of the 70 and 160 mum luminosity could be from star formation, independent of active galactic nucleus (AGN) type. Using a non-parametric test for partial correlation with censored data, we find a statistically significant correlation between the AGN intrinsic power (in the 14-195 keV band) and the FIR emission at 70 and 160 mum for Seyfert 1 galaxies. We find no correlation between the 14-195 keV and FIR luminosities in Seyfert 2 galaxies. The observed correlations suggest two possible scenarios: (1) if we assume that the FIR luminosity is a good tracer of star formation, then there is a connection between star formation and the AGN at sub-kiloparsec scales, or (2) dust heated by the AGN has a statistically significant contribution to the FIR emission. Using a Spearman rank-order analysis, the 14-195 keV luminosities for the Seyfert 1 and 2 galaxies are weakly statistically correlated with the F 70/F 160 ratios.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

@article{Pearson:2014fk,
  abstract = {The different algorithms appropriate for point source photometry on data from the SPIRE instrument on-board the Herschel Space Observatory, within the Herschel Interactive Processing Environment (HIPE) are compared. Point source photometry of a large ensemble of standard calibration stars and dark sky observations is carried out using the 4 major methods within HIPE: SUSSEXtractor, DAOphot, the SPIRE Timeline Fitter and simple Aperture Photometry. Colour corrections and effective beam areas as a function of the assumed source spectral index are also included to produce a large number of photometric measurements per individual target, in each of the 3 SPIRE bands (250, 350, 500 mum), to examine both the accuracy and repeatability of each of the 4 algorithms. It is concluded that for flux densities down to the level of 30mJy that the SPIRE Timeline Fitter is the method of choice. However, at least in the 250 and 350 mum bands, all 4 methods provide photometric repeatability better than a few percent down to at approximately 100mJy. The DAOphot method appears in many cases to have a systematic offset of ˜8 % in all SPIRE bands which may be indicative of a sub-optimal aperture correction. In general, aperture photometry is the least reliable method, i.e. largest scatter between observations, especially in the longest wavelength band. At the faintest fluxes, <30mJy, SUSSEXtractor or DAOphot provide a better alternative to the Timeline Fitter.},

@article{Kocevski:2012lr,
  abstract = {Using Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 imaging taken as part of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey, we examine the role that major galaxy mergers play in triggering active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity at z ~ 2. Our sample consists of 72 moderate-luminosity (L X ~ 1042-44 erg s-1) AGNs at 1.5 < z < 2.5 that are selected using the 4 Ms Chandra observations in the Chandra Deep Field South, the deepest X-ray observations to date. Employing visual classifications, we have analyzed the rest-frame optical morphologies of the AGN host galaxies and compared them to a mass-matched control sample of 216 non-active galaxies at the same redshift. We find that most of the AGNs reside in disk galaxies (51.4+5.8 - 5.9%), while a smaller percentage are found in spheroids (27.8+5.8 - 4.6%). Roughly 16.7+5.3 - 3.5% of the AGN hosts have highly disturbed morphologies and appear to be involved in a major merger or interaction, while most of the hosts (55.6+5.6 - 5.9%) appear relatively relaxed and undisturbed. These fractions are statistically consistent with the fraction of control galaxies that show similar morphological disturbances. These results suggest that the hosts of moderate-luminosity AGNs are no more likely to be involved in an ongoing merger or interaction relative to non-active galaxies of similar mass at z ~ 2. The high disk fraction observed among the AGN hosts also appears to be at odds with predictions that merger-driven accretion should be the dominant AGN fueling mode at z ~ 2, even at moderate X-ray luminosities. Although we cannot rule out that minor mergers are responsible for triggering these systems, the presence of a large population of relatively undisturbed disk-like hosts suggests that the stochastic accretion of gas plays a greater role in fueling AGN activity at z ~ 2 than previously thought.},

@article{Villforth:2014qy,
  abstract = {The processes that trigger active galactic nuclei (AGN) remain poorly understood. While lower luminosity AGN may be triggered by minor disturbances to the host galaxy, stronger disturbances are likely required to trigger luminous AGN. Major wet mergers of galaxies are ideal environments for AGN triggering since they provide large gas supplies and galaxy scale torques. There is however little observational evidence for a strong connection between AGN and major mergers. We analyse the morphological properties of AGN host galaxies as a function of AGN and host galaxy luminosity and compare them to a carefully matched sample of control galaxies. AGN are X-ray selected in the redshift range 0.5 < z < 0.8 and have luminosities 41 ≲ log (LX [erg s-1]) ≲ 44.5. `Fake AGN' are simulated in the control galaxies by adding point sources with the magnitude of the matched AGN. We find that AGN host and control galaxies have comparable asymmetries, S{\'e}rsic indices and ellipticities at rest frame ˜950 nm. AGN host galaxies show neither higher average asymmetries nor higher fractions of very disturbed objects. There is no increase in the prevalence of merger signatures with AGN luminosity. At 95 per cent confidence we find that major mergers are responsible for <6 per cent of all AGN in our sample as well as <40 per cent of the highest luminosity AGN (log (LX [erg s-1]) ˜ 43.5). Major mergers therefore either play only a very minor role in the triggering of AGN in the luminosity range studied or time delays are too long for merger features to remain visible.},

@article{Calzetti:2000fk,
  abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 mum of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at lambda>~40 mum. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T~40-55 K (warm dust) and T~20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ε=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60% of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to ~150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 mum and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 mum is ~1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40% larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 mum is less than 15% of the FIR energy. On average, about 30% of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of ~2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20% when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z>~1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

@article{Bruzual:2003lr,
  abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 1 × 105 and 2 × 1010 yr at a resolution of 3 {\AA} across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 {\AA} for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 {\AA} to 160 mum, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

Nine of the 10 have dominant nonthermal optical emission lines, and the near-infrared colors show a mixture of starburst and AGN energy sources. All appear to be extremely rich in molecular gas.

@article{Schaye:2014xy,
  abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's EAGLE project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and black holes in representative volumes. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and AGN in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the z~0 galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy mass function is reproduced to $\lesssim 0.2$ dex over the full mass range, $10^8 < M_*/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{11}$, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic CIV and OVI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for $M_* \gtrsim 10^9 M_\odot$, they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. The gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. EAGLE constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

@article{Perez-Garcia:2001fk,
  abstract = {We present mid- and far-IR Infrared Space Observatory data of the CfA Seyfert galaxy sample. These data allow a detailed study of the far-IR spectral energy distribution (SED) of these galaxies. A Bayesian inversion method has been used to invert the SED of these objects and to identify three characteristic temperature ranges of dust emission. The method yields two fundamental results, namely, (1) that the mid- and far-IR SED of Seyfert galaxies can be explained solely through thermal reradiation of higher energy photons by dust; and (2) that this thermal emission is made up of three different components, a warm, a cold, and a very cold dust component. These components are characterized by a peak temperature and their emission dominated in each case by a single astrophysical mechanism. These mechanisms have been readily explained as produced, respectively, by warm dust heated by either the active nucleus or circumnuclear starbursts, cold dust heated by a star-forming region in the galaxy disk, and very cold dust heated by the general interstellar radiation field. Comparisons between the parameters obtained from the analysis of the IR SEDs (fluxes, temperatures, luminosities) have been made. Our results suggest that the emission in the mid-IR is anisotropic and the differences found between Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies could be explained with thin molecular tori models.

@article{Bonatto:1997lr,
  abstract = {This paper presents an analysis of moderately large samples of type 1 and 2 Seyfert galaxies through optical observations and far-infrared IRAS data, also taking into account theoretical color indices derived from dust emission models. The galaxies in the samples cover a rather large interval in far-infrared luminosity, i.e., 7.6 <= log (LIR/L&sun;) <= 12.6. We show that both types of Seyferts have approximately the same distribution of number of objects with a given LIR. Galaxies with similar far-infrared color indices alpha(100, 60) are grouped together, and the corresponding average color indices are interpreted in terms of a simple model in which the observed colors result from the combination of dust directly heated by the active galactic nucleus with a component from the host galaxy represented by the emission of cool dust. On the basis of the average IRAS colors of the derived groups, we show that type 1 and 2 Seyfert galaxies are undistinguishable from each other. From the luminosity ratios LIR/LHalpha and LIR/L[O III], we show that basically the same model can be applied to both types of Seyfert, only allowing for the variation of model conditions: type 2 Seyferts would be like type 1 Seyferts but with the Seyfert nucleus and broad line region more effectively ``hidden'' by dust.

@article{Charlot:2001rt,
  abstract = {We present a new model for computing consistently the line and continuum emission from galaxies, based on a combination of recent population synthesis and photoionization codes. We use effective parameters to describe the Hii regions and the diffuse gas ionized by single stellar generations in a galaxy, among which the most important ones are the zero-age effective ionization parameter, the effective gas metallicity and the effective dust-to-heavy element ratio. We calibrate the nebular properties of our model using the observed [Oiii]/Hbeta, [Oii]/[Oiii], [Sii]/Halpha and [Nii]/[Sii] ratios of a representative sample of nearby spiral and irregular, starburst and Hii galaxies. To compute whole (line plus continuum) spectral energy distributions, we include the absorption by dust in the neutral interstellar medium (ISM) using a recent simple prescription, which is consistent with observations of nearby starburst galaxies. Our model enables us to interpret quantitatively the observed optical spectra of galaxies in terms of stars, gas and dust parameters. We find that the range of ionized-gas properties spanned by nearby galaxies implies factors of 3.5 and 14 variations in the Halpha and [Oii] luminosities produced per unit star formation rate (SFR). When accounting for stellar Halpha absorption and absorption by dust in the neutral ISM, the actual uncertainties in SFR estimates based on the emergent Halpha and [Oii] luminosities are as high as several decades. We derive new estimators of the SFR, the gas-phase oxygen abundance and the effective absorption optical depth of the dust in galaxies. We show that, with the help of other lines such as [Oii], Hbeta, [Oiii], [Nii] or [Sii], the uncertainties in SFR estimates based on Halpha can be reduced to a factor of only 2-3, even if the Halpha line is blended with the adjacent [Nii] lines. Without Halpha, however, the SFR is difficult to estimate from the [Oii], Hbeta and [Oiii] lines. The reason for this is that the absorption by dust in the neutral ISM and the ionized-gas parameters are then difficult to constrain independently. This suggests that, while insufficient by itself, the Halpha line is essential for estimating the star formation rate from the optical emission of a galaxy.},

  abstract = {We present XMM-Newton spectral analysis of all 38 Seyfert galaxies from the Palomar spectroscopic sample of galaxies. These are found at distances of up to 67 Mpc and cover the absorbed 2-10 keV luminosity range ~1038-1043 erg s-1. Our aim is to determine the distribution of the X-ray absorption in the local Universe. Three of these are Compton-thick with column densities just above 1024 cm-2 and high equivalent width FeKalpha lines (>700 eV). Five more sources have low values of the X-ray to [OIII] flux ratio suggesting that they could be associated with obscured nuclei. Their individual spectra show neither high absorbing columns nor flat spectral indices. However, their stacked spectrum reveals an absorbing column density of NH ~ 1023 cm-2. Therefore the fraction of absorbed sources (>1022 cm-2) could be as high as 55$\pm$12%. A number of Seyfert-2 appear to host unabsorbed nuclei. These are associated with low-luminosity sources LX < 3×1041 erg s-1. Their stacked spectrum again shows no absorption while inspection of the Chandra images, where available, shows that contamination from nearby sources does not affect the XMM-Newton spectra in most cases. Nevertheless, such low luminosity sources are not contributing significantly to the X-ray background flux. When we consider only the brighter, >1041 erg s-1, 21 sources, we find that the fraction of absorbed nuclei rises to 75$\pm$19% while that of Compton-thick sources to 15-20%. The fraction of Compton-thick AGN is lower than that predicted by the X-ray background synthesis model in the same luminosity and redshift range.},

@article{Beckmann:2009rc,
  abstract = {Aims: The INTEGRAL mission provides a large data set for studying the hard X-ray properties of AGN and allows testing of the unified scheme for AGN.  Methods: We present analysis of INTEGRAL IBIS/ISGRI, JEM-X, and OMC data for 199 AGN supposedly detected by INTEGRAL above 20 keV. Results: The data analysed here allow significant spectral extraction on 148 objects and an optical variability study of 57 AGN. The slopes of the hard X-ray spectra of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies are found to be consistent within the uncertainties, whereas higher cut-off energies and lower luminosities we measured for the more absorbed/type 2 AGN. The intermediate Seyfert 1.5 objects exhibit hard X-ray spectra consistent with those of Seyfert 1. When applying a Compton reflection model, the underlying continua appear the same in Seyfert 1 and 2 with Gamma ~= 2, and the reflection strength is about R ~= 1, when assuming different inclination angles. A significant correlation is found between the hard X-ray and optical luminosity and the mass of the central black hole in the sense that the more luminous objects appear to be more massive. There is also a general trend toward the absorbed sources and type 2 AGN having lower Eddington ratios. The black hole mass appears to form a fundamental plane together with the optical and X-ray luminosity of the form LV ∝ LX0.6 MBH0.2, similar to what is found between LR, LX, and MBH. Conclusions: The transition from the type 1 to type 2 AGN appears to be smooth. The type 2 AGN are less luminous and have less accreting super massive black holes. The unified model for Seyfert galaxies seems to hold, showing in hard X-rays that the central engine is the same in Seyfert 1 and 2, but seen under different inclination angles and absorption. The fundamental plane links the accretion mechanism with the bulge of the host galaxy and with the mass of the central engine in the same way in all types of Seyfert galaxies.

@article{Brightman:2011qr,
  abstract = {We present a multi-waveband analysis of a 126-galaxy sub-sample of the 12 mum galaxy sample (12MGS), for which we have carried out a detailed X-ray spectral analysis in a previous paper. We determine the activity class of the galaxies by way of optical-line ratio diagnostics and characterize the optical classes by their X-ray, 12 mum and [O III] luminosities and X-ray spectral properties. Our most interesting results from this investigation are as follows. (i) Seyfert (Sy) 1s and Sy2s show a significantly different X-ray luminosity distributions from each other. (ii) Sy2 galaxies with a detection of a hidden broad-line region show a significantly higher X-ray luminosity than those without a detection, supporting the findings of Tran. (iii) Sy1s also present a significantly different 12 mum luminosity distribution from both intermediate Sy types and Sy2s. (iv) The Sy2 fraction decreases towards high X-ray luminosities. (v) X-ray indications of active galactic nuclei (AGN) power agree well with the optical classifications. (vi) There is X-ray evidence for the presence of an AGN in 17 per cent of H II/AGN composite galaxies and 40 per cent of LINERs. (vii) We advocate the use of a 2-10 keV X-ray luminosity of 1041 erg s-1 in the X-ray selection of AGN, rather than 1042 erg s-1, which we find gives a contamination rate of only 3 per cent from star-forming galaxies. (viii) From an analysis of the X-ray power-law index, Gamma, we find that Sy1s and Sy2 have the same intrinsic distributions, implying that the central engines are the same, in support of AGN unification schemes. (ix) In 24 per cent of cases the absorption measured in the X-ray spectra does not correspond directly to that implied in the optical band from the visibility of the broad-line regions (BLRs), which is in conflict with AGN unification schemes. (x) We confirm the previous work showing that the obscured fraction in AGN declines at high X-ray luminosity, but also find a decrease at low luminosity having peaked at LX˜ 1042 erg s-1, suggesting that source luminosity has a large effect on the obscuring material, therefore also calling for a modification to unified schemes. (xi) The average obscured and Compton-thick fractions for this sample are 62 $\pm$ 5 per cent and 20 $\pm$ 4 per cent, respectively, which are higher than hard X-ray and optically selected samples, therefore supporting mid-infrared (MIR) selection as a relatively unbiased method of selecting AGN. (xii) We assess the use of the 'T' ratio (?) for selecting Compton-thick candidates. We conclude here that this quantity can often be unreliable due to uncertainties in the extinction corrections to the [O III] flux. These results have important impacts on AGN selection and unification, and the results from the 12MGS are particularly useful as a local analogue to Spitzer/MIPS 24 mum samples selected at z= 1, as observed 24 mum emission originates at rest-frame 12 mum in sources at this redshift.},

  abstract = {We constrain the slope of the star formation rate (SFR; log Psi) to stellar mass (log M sstarf) relation down to log (M sstarf/M &sun;) = 8.4 (log (M sstarf/M &sun;) = 9.2) at z = 0.5 (z = 2.5) with a mass-complete sample of 39,106 star-forming galaxies selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs, using deep photometry in the CANDELS fields. For the first time, we find that the slope is dependent on stellar mass, such that it is steeper at low masses (log Psivproplog M sstarf) than at high masses (log Psivprop(0.3-0.6)log M sstarf). These steeper low-mass slopes are found for three different star formation indicators: the combination of the ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR), calibrated from a stacking analysis of Spitzer/MIPS 24 mum imaging; beta-corrected UV SFRs; and Halpha SFRs. The normalization of the sequence evolves differently in distinct mass regimes as well: for galaxies less massive than log (M sstarf/M &sun;) < 10 the specific SFR (Psi/M sstarf) is observed to be roughly self-similar with Psi/M sstarfvprop(1 + z)1.9, whereas more massive galaxies show a stronger evolution with Psi/M sstarfvprop(1 + z)2.2-3.5 for log (M sstarf/M &sun;) = 10.2-11.2. The fact that we find a steep slope of the star formation sequence for the lower mass galaxies will help reconcile theoretical galaxy formation models with the observations.},

  abstract = {As a step toward a comprehensive overview of the infrared diagnostics of the central engines and host galaxies of quasars at low redshift, we present Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopic (5-40 {\mu}m) and photometric (24, 70 and 160 {\mu}m) measurements of all Palomar-Green (PG) quasars at z < 0.5 and 2MASS quasars at z < 0.3. We supplement these data with Herschel measurements at 160 {\mu}m. The sample is composed of 87 optically selected PG quasars and 52 near-IR selected 2MASS quasars. Here we present the data, measure the prominent spectral features, and separate emission due to star formation from that emitted by the dusty circumnuclear torus. We find that the mid-IR (5-30 {\mu}m) spectral shape for the torus is largely independent of quasar IR luminosity with scatter in the SED shape of ~ 0.2 dex. Except for the silicate features, no large difference is observed between PG (unobscured - silicate emission) and 2MASS (obscured - silicate absorption) quasars. Only mild silicate features are observed in both cases. When in emission, the peak wavelength of the silicate feature tends to be longer than 9.7 {\mu}m, possibly indicating effects on grain properties near the AGN. The IR color is shown to correlate with the equivalent width of the aromatic features, indicating that the slope of the quasar mid- to far-IR SED is to first order driven by the fraction of radiation from star formation in the IR bands.},

@article{Bongiorno:2012db,
  abstract = {Using the wide multiband photometry available in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field, we explore the host galaxy properties of a large sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs; ˜1700 objects) with Lbol ranging from 1043 to 1047 erg s-1, obtained by combining X-ray and optical spectroscopic selections. Based on a careful study of their spectral energy distributions, which have been parametrized using a two-component (AGN+galaxy) model fit, we have derived dust-corrected rest-frame magnitudes, colours and stellar masses of the obscured and unobscured AGN hosts up to high redshift (z≲3). Moreover, for the sample of obscured AGNs, we have also derived reliable star formation rates (SFRs). We find that AGN hosts span a large range of stellar masses and SFRs. No colour-bimodality is seen at any redshift in the AGN hosts, which are found to be mainly massive, red galaxies. Once we have accounted for the colour-mass degeneracy in well-defined mass-matched samples, we find a residual (marginal) enhancement of the incidence of AGNs in redder galaxies with lower specific SFRs. We argue that this result might emerge because of our ability to properly account for AGN light contamination and dust extinction, compared to surveys with a more limited multiwavelength coverage. However, because these colour shifts are relatively small, systematic effects could still be considered responsible for some of the observed trends. Interestingly, we find that the probability for a galaxy to host a black hole that is growing at any given 'specific accretion rate' (i.e. the ratio of X-ray luminosity to the host stellar mass) is almost independent of the host galaxy mass, while it decreases as a power law with LX/M*. By analysing the normalization of such a probability distribution, we show how the incidence of AGNs increases with redshift as rapidly as (1 + z)4, which closely resembles the overall evolution of the specific SFR of the entire galaxy population. We provide analytical fitting formulae that describe the probability of a galaxy of any mass (above the completeness limit of the COSMOS) to host an AGN of any given specific accretion rate as a function of redshift. These can be useful tools for theoretical studies of the growing population of black holes within galaxy evolution models. Although AGN activity and star formation in galaxies do appear to have a common triggering mechanism, at least in a statistical sense, within the COSMOS sample, we do not find any conclusive evidence to suggest that AGNs have a powerful influence on the star-forming properties of their host galaxies.},

@article{Shao:2010fp,
  abstract = {Sensitive Herschel far-infrared observations can break degeneracies that were inherent to previous studies of star formation in high-z AGN hosts. Combining PACS 100 and 160 mum observations of the GOODS-N field with 2 Ms Chandra data, we detect  20% of X-ray AGN individually at >3sigma. The host far-infrared luminosity of AGN with L2-10 keV ≈ 1043 erg s-1 increases with redshift by an order of magnitude from z = 0 to z   1. In contrast, there is little dependence of far-infrared luminosity on AGN luminosity, for {L2-10 keV} ⪅ 1044 erg s-1 AGN at z ⪆ 1. We do not find a dependence of far-infrared luminosity on X-ray obscuring column, for our sample which is dominated by L2-10 keV < 1044 erg s-1 AGN. In conjunction with properties of local and luminous high-z AGN, we interpret these results as reflecting the interplay between two paths of AGN/host coevolution. A correlation of AGN luminosity and host star formation is traced locally over a wide range of luminosities and also extends to luminous high-z AGN. This correlation reflects an evolutionary connection, likely via merging. For lower AGN luminosities, star formation is similar to that in non-active massive galaxies and shows little dependence on AGN luminosity. The level of this secular, non-merger driven star formation increasingly dominates over the correlation at increasing redshift.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

@article{Silverman:2009lq,
  abstract = {We present a study of the host galaxies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected from the zCOSMOS survey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and star formation are explicitly linked up to z ~ 1. We identify 152 galaxies that harbor AGN, based on their X-ray emission (L 0.5-10 keV>1042 erg s-1) detected by XMM-Newton observations of 7543 galaxies (i acs < 22.5). Star formation rates (SFRs), including those weighted by stellar mass, of a subsample are determined using the [O II]lambda3727 emission-line luminosity, corrected for an AGN contribution based on the observed [O III]lambda5007 strength or that inferred by their hard (2-10 keV) X-ray luminosity. We find that an overwhelming majority of AGN host galaxies have significant levels of star formation with a distribution spanning ~1-100 M sun yr-1 their average SFR is higher than that of galaxies with equivalent stellar mass (M *>4 × 1010 M sun). The close association between AGN activity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the fraction of galaxies hosting AGN with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-frame color (U-V) and spectral index Dn (4000); we demonstrate that a mass-selected sample is required to alleviate an artificial peak in the AGN fraction falling in the transition region due to the fact that many blue cloud galaxies have low mass-to-light ratios in luminosity-limited samples. We also find that the SFRs of AGN hosts evolve with cosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population and naturally explains the low SFRs in AGNs (z < 0.3) from the SDSS. We conclude that the conditions most conducive for AGN activity are a massive host galaxy and a large reservoir of gas. Furthermore, a direct correlation between mass-accretion rate onto SMBHs and SFR is shown to be weak although the average ratio (~10-2) is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for a co-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales (i.e., within the same galaxies). The order-of-magnitude increase in this ratio compared to the locally measured value of M BH/M bulge is consistent with an AGN lifetime substantially shorter than that of star formation. Our findings illustrate an intermittent scenario with underlying complexities regarding fueling over vastly different physical (and temporal) scales yet to be firmly determined.},

@article{Vito:2014eu,
  abstract = {We have investigated the gas content of a sample of several hundred AGN host galaxies at z < 1 and compared it with a sample of inactive galaxies, matched in bins of stellar mass and redshift. Gas masses have been inferred from the dust masses, obtained by stacked Herschel far-IR and sub-mm data in the GOODS and COSMOS fields, under reasonable assumptions and metallicity scaling relations for the dust-to-gas ratio. We find that AGNs are on average hosted in galaxies much more gas rich than inactive galaxies. In the vast majority of stellar mass bins, the average gas content of AGN hosts is higher than that in inactive galaxies. The difference is up to a factor of 10 higher in low-stellar-mass galaxies, with a significance of 6.5sigma. In almost half of the AGN sample, the gas content is three times higher than that in the control sample of inactive galaxies. Our result strongly suggests that the probability of having an AGN activated is simply driven by the amount of gas in the host galaxy; this can be explained in simple terms of statistical probability of having a gas cloud falling into the gravitational potential of the black hole. The increased probability of an AGN being hosted by a star-forming galaxy, identified by previous works, may be a consequence of the relationship between gas content and AGN activity, found in this paper, combined with the Schmidt-Kennicutt law for star formation.},

@article{Bouwens:2012fv,
  abstract = {Ultra-deep Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) and WFC3/IR HUDF+HUDF09 data, along with the wide-area GOODS+ERS+CANDELS data over the CDF-S GOODS field, are used to measure UV colors, expressed as the UV-continuum slope beta, of star-forming galaxies over a wide range of luminosity (0.1L* z = 3 to 2L* z = 3) at high redshift (z ~ 7 to z ~ 4). beta is measured using all ACS and WFC3/IR passbands uncontaminated by Lyalpha and spectral breaks. Extensive tests show that our beta measurements are only subject to minimal biases. Using a different selection procedure, Dunlop et al. recently found large biases in their beta measurements. To reconcile these different results, we simulated both approaches and found that beta measurements for faint sources are subject to large biases if the same passbands are used both to select the sources and to measure beta. High-redshift galaxies show a well-defined rest-frame UV color-magnitude (CM) relationship that becomes systematically bluer toward fainter UV luminosities. No evolution is seen in the slope of the UV CM relationship in the first 1.5 Gyr, though there is a small evolution in the zero point to redder colors from z ~ 7 to z ~ 4. This suggests that galaxies are evolving along a well-defined sequence in the L UV-color (beta) plane (a star-forming sequence?). Dust appears to be the principal factor driving changes in the UV color beta with luminosity. These new larger beta samples lead to improved dust extinction estimates at z ~ 4-7 and confirm that the extinction is essentially zero at low luminosities and high redshifts. Inclusion of the new dust extinction results leads to (1) excellent agreement between the star formation rate (SFR) density at z ~ 4-8 and that inferred from the stellar mass density; and (2) to higher specific star formation rates (SSFRs) at z >~ 4, suggesting that the SSFR may evolve modestly (by factors of ~2) from z ~ 4-7 to z ~ 2.  Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. These observations are associated with programs 11563 and 9797.},

@article{Heinis:2014yg,
  abstract = {We study the link between observed ultraviolet (UV) luminosity, stellar mass and dust attenuation within rest-frame UV-selected samples at z ˜ 4, ˜ 3 and ˜1.5. We measure by stacking at 250, 350 and 500 mum in the Herschel/Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver images from the Herschel Multi-Tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) program the average infrared luminosity as a function of stellar mass and UV luminosity. We find that dust attenuation is mostly correlated with stellar mass. There is also a secondary dependence with UV luminosity: at a given UV luminosity, dust attenuation increases with stellar mass, while at a given stellar mass it decreases with UV luminosity. We provide new empirical recipes to correct for dust attenuation given the observed UV luminosity and the stellar mass. Our results also enable us to put new constraints on the average relation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass at z ˜ 4, ˜3 and ˜1.5. The SFR-stellar mass relations are well described by power laws (SFR∝ M_*^{0.7}), with the amplitudes being similar at z ˜ 4 and ˜3, and decreasing by a factor of 4 at z ˜ 1.5 at a given stellar mass. We further investigate the evolution with redshift of the specific SFR. Our results are in the upper range of previous measurements, in particular at z ˜ 3, and are consistent with a plateau at 3 < z < 4. Current model predictions (either analytic, semi-analytic or hydrodynamic) are inconsistent with these values, as they yield lower predictions than the observations in the redshift range we explore. We use these results to discuss the star formation histories of galaxies in the framework of the main sequence of star-forming galaxies. Our results suggest that galaxies at high redshift (2.5 < z < 4) stay around 1 Gyr on the main sequence. With decreasing redshift, this time increases such that z = 1 main-sequence galaxies with 108<M_*/{M}_{{&sun;}}<10^{10} stay on the main sequence until z = 0.},

@article{Silverman:2008zl,
  abstract = {We present an analysis of 109 moderate-luminosity (41.9<=logL0.5-8.0keV<=43.7) AGNs in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South survey, which is drawn from 5549 galaxies from the COMBO-17 and GEMS surveys having 0.4<=z<=1.1. These obscured or optically weak AGNs facilitate the study of their host galaxies since the AGNs provide an insubstantial amount of contamination to the galaxy light. We find that the color distribution of AGN host galaxies is highly dependent on (1) the strong color-evolution of luminous (MV<-20.7) galaxies, and (2) the influence of ~10 Mpc scale structures. When excluding galaxies within the redshift range 0.63<=z<=0.76, a regime dominated by sources in large-scale structures at z=0.67 and z=0.73, we observe a bimodality in the host galaxy colors. Galaxies hosting AGNs at z>~0.8 preferentially have bluer (rest-frame U-V<0.7) colors than their z<~0.6 counterparts (many of which fall along the red sequence). The fraction of galaxies hosting AGNs peaks in the ``green valley'' (0.5<U-V<1.0) this is primarily due to enhanced AGN activity in the redshift interval 0.63<=z<=0.76. The AGN fraction in this redshift and color interval is 12.8% (compared to its ``field'' value of 7.8%) and reaches a maximum of 14.8% at U-V~0.8. We further find that blue, bulge-dominated (S{\'e}rsic index n>2.5) galaxies have the highest fraction of AGN (21%) in our sample. We explore the scenario that the evolution of AGN hosts is driven by galaxy mergers and illustrate that an accurate assessment requires a larger area survey since only three hosts may be undergoing a merger with timescales <~1 Gyr following a starburst phase.},

We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (ultraviolet) and SDSS photometry to a library of dust-attenuated population synthesis models. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those from SDSS-measured emission lines (Halpha). Deviations from perfect agreement are shown to be due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to Halpha measurements, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak Halpha, and where Halpha is contaminated with AGN emission (1/2 of the sample). Using full-SED SFRs, we calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX far- and near-UV magnitudes to produce dust-corrected SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGNs, (2) those hosting an AGN, and (3) galaxies without Halpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGNs lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Star-forming galaxies without an AGN lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. On the other hand, weak AGNs, while also massive, have lower SFRs, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies via strong and weak AGNs. We confirm that some galaxies with no Halpha show signs of star formation in the UV. We derive a cosmic star formation density at z=0.1 with significantly smaller total error than previous measurements.},

@article{Nandra:2007rz,
  abstract = {We discuss the relationship between rest-frame color and optical luminosity for X-ray sources in the range 0.6<z<1.4 selected from the Chandra survey of the Extended Groth Strip. These objects are almost exclusively active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While there are a few luminous QSOs, most are relatively weak or obscured AGNs whose optical colors should be dominated by host galaxy light. The vast majority of AGN hosts at z~1 are luminous and red, with very few objects fainter than MB=-20.5 or bluer than U-B=0.6. This places the AGNs in a distinct region of color-magnitude space, on the ``red sequence'' or at the top of the ``blue cloud,'' with many in between these two modes in galaxy color. A key stage in the evolution of massive galaxies is when star formation is quenched, resulting in a migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence. Our results are consistent with scenarios in which AGNs either cause or maintain this quenching. The large number of red-sequence AGNs implies that strong, ongoing star formation is not a necessary ingredient for AGN activity, as black hole accretion appears often to persist after star formation has been terminated.},

  abstract = {We perform two-dimensional, point-spread-function-convolved, bulge+disk decompositions in the g and r bandpasses on a sample of 1,123,718 galaxies from the Legacy area of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Seven. Four different decomposition procedures are investigated which make improvements to sky background determinations and object deblending over the standard SDSS procedures that lead to more robust structural parameters and integrated galaxy magnitudes and colors, especially in crowded environments. We use a set of science-based quality assurance metrics, namely, the disk luminosity-size relation, the galaxy color-magnitude diagram, and the galaxy central (fiber) colors to show the robustness of our structural parameters. The best procedure utilizes simultaneous, two-bandpass decompositions. Bulge and disk photometric errors remain below 0.1 mag down to bulge and disk magnitudes of g ~= 19 and r ~= 18.5. We also use and compare three different galaxy fitting models: a pure S{\'e}rsic model, an nb = 4 bulge + disk model, and a S{\'e}rsic (free nb ) bulge + disk model. The most appropriate model for a given galaxy is determined by the F-test probability. All three catalogs of measured structural parameters, rest-frame magnitudes, and colors are publicly released here. These catalogs should provide an extensive comparison set for a wide range of observational and theoretical studies of galaxies.},

@article{Lackner:2012ty,
  abstract = {We present a set of bulge-disc decompositions for a sample of 71 825 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) main-sample galaxies in the redshift range 0.003 < z < 0.05. We have fitted each galaxy with either a de Vaucouleurs ('classical') or an exponential ('pseudo-') bulge and an exponential disc. Two-dimensional S{\'e}rsic fits are performed when the two-component fits are not statistically significant or when the fits are poor, even in the presence of high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N). We study the robustness of our two-component fits by studying a bright subsample of galaxies and we study the systematics of these fits with decreasing resolution and S/N. Only 30 per cent of our sample have been fitted with two-component fits in which both components are non-zero. The g-r and g-i colours of each component for the two-component models are determined using linear templates derived from the r-band model. We attempt a physical classification of types of fits into disc galaxies, pseudo-bulges, classical bulges and ellipticals. Our classification of galaxies agrees well with previous large bulge plus disc (B+D) decomposed samples. Using our galaxy classifications, we find that Petrosian concentration is a good indicator of bulge-to-total ratio, while overall S{\'e}rsic index is not. Additionally, we find that the majority of green valley galaxies are bulge+disc galaxies. Furthermore, in the transition from green to red B+D galaxies, the total galaxy colour is most strongly correlated with the disc colour.},

@article{Magorrian:1998qv,
  abstract = {We construct dynamical models for a sample of 36 nearby galaxies with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry and ground-based kinematics. The models assume that each galaxy is axisymmetric, with a two-integral distribution function, arbitrary inclination angle, a position-independent stellar mass-to-light ratio Upsilon, and a central massive dark object (MDO) of arbitrary mass M_*. They provide acceptable fits to 32 of the galaxies for some value of M_* and Upsilon the four galaxies that cannot be fitted have kinematically decoupled cores. The mass-to-light ratios inferred for the 32 well-fitted galaxies are consistent with the fundamental-plane correlation Upsilon ~ L^0.2, where L is galaxy luminosity. In all but six galaxies the models require at the 95% confidence level an MDO of mass M_* ~ 0.006M_bulge = 0.006UpsilonL. Five of the six galaxies consistent with M_* = 0 are also consistent with this correlation. The other (NGC 7332) has a much stronger upper limit on M_*. We predict the second-moment profiles that should be observed at HST resolution for the 32 galaxies that our models describe well. We consider various parameterizations for the probability distribution describing the correlation of the masses of these MDOs with other galaxy properties. One of the best models can be summarized thus: a fraction f ~= 0.97 of early-type galaxies have MDOs, whose masses are well described by a Gaussian distribution in log (M_*/M_bulge) of mean -2.28 and standard deviation ~0.51. There is also marginal evidence that M_* is distributed differently for ``core'' and ``power law'' galaxies, with core galaxies having a somewhat steeper dependence on M_bulge.},

@article{Gebhardt:2000xy,
  abstract = {We describe a correlation between the mass Mbh of a galaxy's central black hole and the luminosity-weighted line-of-sight velocity dispersion sigmae within the half-light radius. The result is based on a sample of 26 galaxies, including 13 galaxies with new determinations of black hole masses from Hubble Space Telescope measurements of stellar kinematics. The best-fit correlation is Mbh=1.2(+/-0.2)×108 Msolar(sigmae/200 km s-1)3.75 (+/-0.3) over almost 3 orders of magnitude in Mbh; the scatter in Mbh at fixed sigmae is only 0.30 dex, and most of this is due to observational errors. The Mbh-sigmae relation is of interest not only for its strong predictive power but also because it implies that central black hole mass is constrained by and closely related to properties of the host galaxy's bulge.},

@article{Patton:2008ty,
  abstract = {We measure the number of companions per galaxy (Nc) as a function of r-band absolute magnitude for both the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Croton and coworkers semianalytic catalog applied to the Millennium Run simulation. For close pairs with projected separations of 5-20 h-1 kpc, velocity differences less than 500 km s-1, and luminosity ratios between 1:2 and 2:1, we find good agreement between the observations and simulations, with Nc consistently close to 0.02 over the range -22<Mr<-18. For larger pair separations, Nc(Mr) instead becomes increasingly steep toward the faint end, implying that luminosity-dependent clustering plays an important role on small scales. Using the simulations to assess and correct for projection effects, we infer that the real-space Nc(Mr) for close pairs peaks at about M* and declines by at least a factor of 2 as Mr becomes fainter. Conversely, by measuring the number density of close companions, we estimate that at least 90% of all major mergers occur between galaxies which are fainter than L*. Finally, measurements of the luminosity density of close companions indicate that L* galaxies likely dominate in terms of the overall importance of major mergers in the evolution of galaxy populations at low redshift.},

  abstract = {We discuss the merger rate, close galaxy environment, and clustering on scales up to an Mpc of the Swift BAT hard X-ray sample of nearby (z<0.05), moderate-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We find a higher incidence of galaxies with signs of disruption compared to a matched control sample (18% versus 1%) and of close pairs within 30 kpc (24% versus 1%). We also find a larger fraction with companions compared to normal galaxies and optical emission line selected AGNs at scales up to 250 kpc. We hypothesize that these merging AGNs may not be identified using optical emission line diagnostics because of optical extinction and dilution by star formation. In support of this hypothesis, in merging systems we find a higher hard X-ray to [O III] flux ratio, as well as emission line diagnostics characteristic of composite or star-forming galaxies, and a larger IRAS 60 mum to stellar mass ratio.},

@article{Lintott:2008qv,
  abstract = {In order to understand the formation and subsequent evolution of galaxies one must first distinguish between the two main morphological classes of massive systems: spirals and early-type systems. This paper introduces a project, Galaxy Zoo, which provides visual morphological classifications for nearly one million galaxies, extracted from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This achievement was made possible by inviting the general public to visually inspect and classify these galaxies via the internet. The project has obtained more than 4 × 107 individual classifications made by ~105 participants. We discuss the motivation and strategy for this project, and detail how the classifications were performed and processed. We find that Galaxy Zoo results are consistent with those for subsets of SDSS galaxies classified by professional astronomers, thus demonstrating that our data provide a robust morphological catalogue. Obtaining morphologies by direct visual inspection avoids introducing biases associated with proxies for morphology such as colour, concentration or structural parameters. In addition, this catalogue can be used to directly compare SDSS morphologies with older data sets. The colour-magnitude diagrams for each morphological class are shown, and we illustrate how these distributions differ from those inferred using colour alone as a proxy for morphology.  This publication has been made possible by the participation of more than 100000 volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project. Their contributions are individually acknowledged at http://www.galaxyzoo.org/Volunteers.aspx  E-mail: cjl@astro.ox.ac.uk (CJL); kevins@astro.ox.ac.uk (KS)},

  abstract = {The authors discuss statistical techniques applicable when a portion of an object sample is not detected; i.e., when upper limits, or left-censored data, are present. An extensive field of statistics called survival analysis of lifetime data exists to address these problems. This paper presents the foundations of nonparametric univariate survival analysis and discusses its application to astronomical data. The Kaplan-Meier product-limit estimator, its variance, mean, and standard deviation are presented. It provides a maximum-likelihood-type reconstruction of the true distribution function when upper limits are present. Three nonparametric procedures for testing whether or not two censored samples are drawn from the same distribution - the Gehan, logrank, and Peto-Prentice tests - are described. Some illustrative examples using astronomical data sets are included.},

  abstract = {Five methods for obtaining linear regression fits to bivariate data with unknown or insignificant measurement errors are discussed: ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression of Y on X, OLS regression of X on Y, the bisector of the two OLS lines, orthogonal regression, and 'reduced major-axis' regression. These methods have been used by various researchers in observational astronomy, most importantly in cosmic distance scale applications. Formulas for calculating the slope and intercept coefficients and their uncertainties are given for all the methods, including a new general form of the OLS variance estimates. The accuracy of the formulas was confirmed using numerical simulations. The applicability of the procedures is discussed with respect to their mathematical properties, the nature of the astronomical data under consideration, and the scientific purpose of the regression. It is found that, for problems needing symmetrical treatment of the variables, the OLS bisector performs significantly better than orthogonal or reduced major-axis regression.},

@article{Speagle:2014lr,
  abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) Main Sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to $z \sim 6$. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations ($\sim 0.1$ dex 1$\sigma$ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bins. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is $\sim 0.2$ dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best fit $\log\textrm{SFR}(M_*,t) = \left(0.84 \pm 0.02 - 0.026 \pm 0.003 \times t\right) \log M_* - \left(6.51 \pm 0.24 - 0.11 \pm 0.03 \times t\right)$, with $t$ the age of the Universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-$\tau$ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a typical MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial $1\sigma$ spread in formation times of $\sim 1.4$ Gyr.},

@article{Boselli:2013kx,
  abstract = {We present long-slit integrated spectroscopy of 238 late-type galaxies belonging to the Herschel Reference Survey, a volume-limited sample representative of the nearby universe. This sample has a unique legacy value since it was ideally defined for any statistical study of the multifrequency properties of galaxies spanning a wide range in morphological type and luminosity. The spectroscopic observations cover the spectral range 3600-6900 {\AA} at a resolution R ~= 1000 and are thus suitable for separating both the underlying absorption from the emission of the Hbeta line and the two [Nii] lines from the Halpha emission. We measured the fluxes and the equivalent widths of the strongest emission lines ([Oii]lambda3727, Hbeta, [Oiii]lambda4959 and [Oiii]lambda5007, [Nii]lambda6548, Halpha, [Nii]lambda6584, [Sii]lambda6717, and [Sii]lambda6731). We used the data to study the distribution of the equivalent width of all the emission lines, of the Balmer decrement C(Hbeta), and of the observed underlying Balmer absorption under Hbeta (EW Hbetaabs) in this sample. Combining these new spectroscopic data with those available at other frequencies, we also study the dependence of C(Hbeta) and EW Hbetaabs on morphological type, stellar mass, stellar surface density, star formation rate, birthrate parameter, and metallicity in galaxies belonging to different environments (fields vs. Virgo cluster). The distribution of the equivalent width of all the emission lines, of C(Hbeta) (or equivalently of A(Halpha)), and of EW Hbetaabs are systematically different in cluster and field galaxies. The Balmer decrement increases with the stellar mass, stellar surface density, metallicity, and star formation rate of the observed galaxies, while it is unexpectedly almost independent of the column density of the atomic and molecular gas. The dependence of C(Hbeta) on stellar mass is steeper than previously found in other works. The underlying Balmer absorption does not significantly change with any of these physical parameters.

@article{Cortese:2012fj,
  abstract = {We present GALEX far-ultraviolet (FUV) and near-ultraviolet (NUV) as well as SDSS g, r, i photometry and structural parameters for the Herschel Reference Survey, a magnitude-, volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies in different environments. We use this unique dataset to investigate the ultraviolet (UV) structural scaling relations of nearby galaxies and to determine how the properties of the UV disk vary with atomic hydrogen content and environment. We find a clear change of slope in the stellar mass vs. effective surface brightness relation when moving from the optical to the UV, with more massive galaxies having brighter optical but fainter UV surface brightnesses than smaller systems. A similar change of slope is also seen in the radius vs. surface brightness relation. By comparing our observations with the predictions of a simple multi-zone chemical model of galaxy evolution, we show that these findings are a natural consequence of a much more efficient inside-out growth of the stellar disk in massive galaxies. We confirm that isophotal radii are always a better proxy for the size of the stellar/star-forming disk than effective quantities and we show that the extent of the UV disk (normalized to the optical size) is strongly correlated to the integrated Hi gas fraction. This relation still holds even when cluster spirals are considered, with Hi-deficient systems having less extended star-forming disks than Hi-normal galaxies. Interestingly, the star formation in the inner part of Hi-deficient galaxies is significantly less affected by the removal of the atomic hydrogen, as expected in a simple ram-pressure stripping scenario. These results suggest that it is the amount of Hi that regulates the growth of the star-forming disk in the outskirts of galaxies.

  abstract = {In this work, we investigate the dependence of the covering factor (CF) of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) on the mid-infrared (MIR) luminosity and the redshift. We constructed 12 and 22 mum luminosity functions (LFs) at 0.006 <=z <= 0.3 using Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data. Combining the WISE catalog with Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic data, we selected 223,982 galaxies at 12 mum and 25,721 galaxies at 22 mum for spectroscopic classification. We then identified 16,355 AGNs at 12 mum and 4683 AGNs at 22 mum by their optical emission lines and cataloged classifications in the SDSS. Following that, we estimated the CF as the fraction of Type 2 AGN in all AGNs whose MIR emissions are dominated by the active nucleus (not their host galaxies) based on their MIR colors. We found that the CF decreased with increasing MIR luminosity, regardless of the choice of Type 2 AGN classification criteria, and the CF did not change significantly with redshift for z <= 0.2. Furthermore, we carried out various tests to determine the influence of selection bias and confirmed that similar dependences exist, even when taking these uncertainties into account. The luminosity dependence of the CF can be explained by the receding torus model, but the modified receding torus model gives a slightly better fit, as suggested by Simpson.},

  abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z ~ 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of mass quenching and environment quenching. The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z ~ 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30%-70% of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and alphas for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by Deltaalphas ~ 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and alphas as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making alphas slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching dry merging that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the anti-hierarchical run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative alpha-element abundances.

  abstract = {We use SDSS+GALEX+Galaxy Zoo data to study the quenching of star formation in low-redshift galaxies. We show that the green valley between the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which most blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes morphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue early-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies are transformed from disc to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly. In contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant discs, and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates decline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these conclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a striking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms of the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that late-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of gas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion of the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental processes. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas supply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid quenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disc to spheroid. This gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger, which in most cases transforms galaxies from disc to elliptical morphology, and mergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly active galactic nuclei feedback.},

@article{Gaibler:2012lq,
  abstract = {Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) has become a major component in simulations of galaxy evolution, in particular for massive galaxies. AGN jets have been shown to provide a large amount of energy and are capable of quenching cooling flows. Their impact on the host galaxy, however, is still not understood. Subgrid models of AGN activity in a galaxy evolution context so far have been mostly focused on the quenching of star formation. To shed more light on the actual physics of the 'radio mode' part of AGN activity, we have performed simulations of the interaction of a powerful AGN jet with the massive gaseous disc (1011 M&sun;) of a high-redshift galaxy. We spatially resolve both the jet and the clumpy, multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) and include an explicit star formation model in the simulation. Following the system over more than 107 yr, we find that the jet activity excavates the central region, but overall causes a significant change to the shape of the density probability distribution function and hence the star formation rate due to the formation of a blast wave with strong compression and cooling in the ISM. This results in a ring- or disc-shaped population of young stars. At later times, the increase in star formation rate also occurs in the disc regions further out since the jet cocoon pressurizes the ISM. The total mass of the additionally formed stars may be up to 1010 M&sun; for one duty cycle. We discuss the details of this jet-induced star formation (positive feedback) and its potential consequences for galaxy evolution and observable signatures.},

@article{Schawinski:2009bh,
  abstract = {Residual star formation at late times in early-type galaxies and their progenitors must be suppressed in order to explain the population of red, passively evolving systems we see today. Likewise, residual or newly accreted reservoirs of molecular gas that are fueling star formation must be destroyed. This suppression of star formation in early-type galaxies is now commonly attributed to active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback wherein the reservoir of gas is heated and expelled during a phase of accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. However, direct observational evidence for a link between the destruction of this molecular gas and an AGN phase has been missing so far. We present new mm-wavelength observations from the IRAM 30 m telescope of a sample of low-redshift SDSS early-type galaxies currently undergoing this process of quenching of late-time star formation. Our observations show that the disappearance of the molecular gas coincides within less than 100 Myr with the onset of accretion onto the black hole and is too rapid to be due to star formation alone. Since our sample galaxies are not associated to powerful quasar activity or radio jets, we conclude that low-luminosity AGN episodes are sufficient to suppress residual star formation in early-type galaxies. This suppression mode of AGN feedback is very different from the truncation mode linked to powerful quasar activity during early phases of galaxy formation.},

@article{Kaviraj:2007pd,
  abstract = {We present the first large-scale study of E+A galaxies that incorporates photometry in the ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths. E+A galaxies are `post-starburst' systems, with strong Balmer absorption lines indicating significant recent star formation, but without [OII] and Halpha emission lines which are characteristic of ongoing star formation. The starburst that creates the E+A galaxy typically takes place within the last Gyr and creates a high fraction (20-60 per cent) of the stellar mass in the remnant over a short time-scale (<0.1 Gyr). We find a tight correlation between the luminosity of our E+A galaxies and the implied star formation rate (SFR) during the starburst. While low-luminosity E+As [M(z) > -20] exhibit implied SFRs of less than 50Msolaryr-1, their luminous counterparts [M(z) < -22] show SFRs greater than 300 and as high as 2000Msolaryr-1, suggesting that luminous and ultra-luminous infrared galaxies in the low-redshift Universe could be the progenitors of massive nearby E+A galaxies. We perform a comprehensive study of the characteristics of the quenching that truncates the starburst in E+A systems. We find that, for galaxies less massive than 1010Msolar, the quenching efficiency decreases as the galaxy mass increases. However, for galaxies more massive than 1010Msolar, this trend is reversed and the quenching efficiency increases with galaxy mass. Noting that the mass threshold at which this reversal occurs is in excellent agreement with the mass above which active galactic nuclei (AGN) become significantly more abundant in nearby galaxies, we use simple energetic arguments to show that the bimodal behaviour of the quenching efficiency is consistent with AGN and supernovae (SN) being the principal sources of negative feedback above and below M ~ 1010Msolar, respectively. The arguments assume that quenching occurs through the mechanical ejection or dispersal of the gas reservoir and that, in the high-mass regime (M > 1010Msolar), the Eddington ratios in this sample of galaxies scale as Mgamma, where 1 < gamma < 3. Finally, we use our E+A sample to estimate the time it takes for galaxies to migrate from the blue cloud to the red sequence. We find migration times between 1 and 5 Gyr, with a median value of 1.5 Gyr.},

  abstract = {We use HST/WFC3 imaging from the CANDELS Multi-Cycle Treasury Survey, in conjunction with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, to explore the evolution of galactic structure for galaxies with stellar masses >3 × 1010 M &sun; from z = 2.2 to the present epoch, a time span of 10 Gyr. We explore the relationship between rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity, and galaxy structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z = 2.2 to the present day in the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3 × 1010 M &sun; reported by others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have concentrated light profiles, as parameterized by the S{\'e}rsic index, and the population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the joint distribution of star formation activity, S{\'e}rsic index, stellar mass, inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence correlates poorly with stellar mass at all z < 2.2. Quiescence correlates well with S{\'e}rsic index at all redshifts. Quiescence correlates well with velocity dispersion and stellar surface density at z > 1.3, and somewhat less well at lower redshifts. Yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence and galaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominent bulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominated galaxies have significant star formation. Noting the rarity of quiescent galaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (and perhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important condition for quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10 Gyr, in qualitative agreement with the active galactic nucleus feedback paradigm.},

@article{Khalatyan:2008ul,
  abstract = {We have used the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code GADGET-2 to simulate the formation of an elliptical galaxy in a group-size cosmological dark matter halo with mass Mhalo ~= 3 × 1012h-1Msolar at z = 0. The use of a stellar population synthesis model has allowed us to compute magnitudes, colours and surface brightness profiles. We have included a model to follow the growth of a central black hole and we have compared the results of simulations with and without feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We have studied the interplay between cold gas accretion and merging in the development of galactic morphologies, the link between colour and morphology evolution, the effect of AGN feedback on the photometry of early-type galaxies, the redshift evolution in the properties of quasar hosts, and the impact of AGN winds on the chemical enrichment of the intergalactic medium (IGM).  We have found that the early phases of galaxy formation are driven by the accretion of cold filamentary flows, which form a disc galaxy at the centre of the dark matter halo. Disc star formation rates in this mode of galaxy growth are about as high as the peak star formation rates attained at a later epoch in galaxy mergers. When the dark matter halo is sufficiently massive to support the propagation of a stable shock, the gas in the filaments is heated to the virial temperature, cold accretion is shut down, and the star formation rate begins to decline.  Mergers transform the spiral galaxy into an elliptical one, but they also reactivate star formation by bringing gas into the galaxy. Without a mechanism that removes gas from the merger remnants, the galaxy ends up with blue colours, which are atypical for its elliptical morphology. We have demonstrated that AGN feedback can solve this problem even with a fairly low heating efficiency. Our simulations support a picture where AGN feedback is important for quenching star formation in the remnant of wet mergers and for moving them to the red sequence. This picture is consistent with recent observational results, which suggest that AGN hosts are galaxies in migration from the blue cloud to the red sequence on the colour-magnitude diagram. However, we have also seen a transition in the properties of AGN hosts from blue and star forming at z ~ 2 to mainly red and dead at z ~ 0. Ongoing merging is the primary but not the only triggering mechanism for luminous AGN activity.  Quenching by AGN is only effective after the cold filaments have dried out, since otherwise the galaxy is constantly replenished with gas. AGN feedback also contributes to raising the entropy of the hot IGM by removing low-entropy tails vulnerable to developing cooling flows. We have also demonstrated that AGN winds are potentially important for the metal enrichment of the IGM a high redshift.},

@article{Springel:2005ve,
  abstract = {We use hydrodynamical simulations to study the color transformations induced by star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) during major mergers of spiral galaxies. Our modeling accounts for radiative cooling, star formation, and supernova feedback. Moreover, we include a treatment of accretion onto supermassive black holes embedded in the nuclei of the merging galaxies. We assume that a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of an accreting black hole couples thermally to surrounding gas, providing a feedback mechanism that regulates its growth. The encounter and coalescence of the galaxies triggers nuclear gas inflow, which fuels both a powerful starburst and strong black hole accretion. Comparing simulations with and without black holes, we show that AGN feedback can quench star formation and accretion on a short timescale, particularly in large galaxies where the black holes can drive powerful winds once they become sufficiently massive. The color evolution of the remnant differs markedly between mergers with and without central black holes. Without AGNs, gas-rich mergers lead to elliptical galaxies that remain blue owing to residual star formation, even after more than 7 Gyr have elapsed. In contrast, mergers with black holes produce elliptical galaxies that redden much faster, an effect that is more pronounced in massive remnants where a nearly complete termination of star formation occurs, allowing them to redden to u-r~=2.3 in less than 1 Gyr. AGN feedback may thus be required to explain the population of extremely red massive early-type galaxies, and it appears to be an important driver in generating the observed bimodal color distribution of galaxies in the local universe.},

@article{Bower:2006gf,
  abstract = {Recent observations of the distant Universe suggest that much of the stellar mass of bright galaxies was already in place at z > 1. This presents a challenge for models of galaxy formation because massive haloes are assembled late in the hierarchical clustering process intrinsic to the cold dark matter (CDM) cosmology. In this paper, we discuss a new implementation of the Durham semi-analytic model of galaxy formation in which feedback due to active galactic nuclei (AGN) is assumed to quench cooling flows in massive haloes. This mechanism naturally creates a break in the local galaxy luminosity function at bright magnitudes. The model is implemented within the Millennium N-body simulation. The accurate dark matter merger trees and large number of realizations of the galaxy formation process enabled by this simulation result in highly accurate statistics. After adjusting the values of the physical parameters in the model by reference to the properties of the local galaxy population, we investigate the evolution of the K-band luminosity and galaxy stellar mass functions. We calculate the volume-averaged star formation rate density of the Universe as a function of redshift and the way in which this is apportioned amongst galaxies of different mass. The model robustly predicts a substantial population of massive galaxies out to redshift z ~ 5 and a star formation rate density which rises at least out to z ~ 2 in objects of all masses. Although observational data on these properties have been cited as evidence for `antihierarchical' galaxy formation, we find that when AGN feedback is taken into account, the fundamentally hierarchical CDM model provides a very good match to these observations.},

  abstract = {We have employed a reliable technique of classification of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) based on the fit of well sampled spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with a complete set of AGN and starburst galaxy templates. We have compiled UV, optical, and IR data for a sample of 116 AGNs originally selected for their X-ray and mid-IR emissions (96 with single detections and 20 with double optical counterparts). This is the most complete compilation of multiwavelength data for such a large sample of AGN in the Extended Groth Strip. Through these SEDs, we are able to obtain highly reliable photometric redshifts and to distinguish between pure and host-dominated AGNs. For the objects with unique detection we find that they can be separated into five main groups, namely: Starburst-dominated AGNs (24% of the sample), Starburst-contaminated AGNs (7%), Type-1 AGNs (21%), Type-2 AGNs (24%), and Normal galaxy hosting AGN (24%). We find these groups concentrated at different redshifts: Type-2 AGNs and Normal galaxy hosting AGNs are concentrated at low redshifts, whereas Starburst-dominated AGNs and Type-1 AGNs show a larger span. Correlations between hard/soft X-ray and UV, optical and IR luminosities are reported for the first time for such a sample of AGNs spanning a wide range of redshifts. For the 20 objects with double detection, the percentage of Starburst-dominated AGNs increases up to 48%.},

  abstract = {We use Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys images and a photometric catalog of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field to analyze morphologies of the host galaxies of ~400 active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates at redshifts 0.3 < z < 1.0. We compare the AGN hosts with a sample of nonactive galaxies drawn from the COSMOS field to match the magnitude and redshift distribution of the AGN hosts. We perform two-dimensional surface brightness modeling with GALFIT to yield host galaxy and nuclear point source magnitudes. X-ray-selected AGN host galaxy morphologies span a substantial range that peaks between those of early-type, bulge-dominated and late-type, disk-dominated systems. We also measure the asymmetry and concentration of the host galaxies. Unaccounted for, the nuclear point source can significantly bias results of these measured structural parameters, so we subtract the best-fit point source component to obtain images of the underlying host galaxies. Our concentration measurements reinforce the findings of our two-dimensional morphology fits, placing X-ray AGN hosts between early- and late-type inactive galaxies. AGN host asymmetry distributions are consistent with those of control galaxies. Combined with a lack of excess companion galaxies around AGN, the asymmetry distributions indicate that strong interactions are no more prevalent among AGN than normal galaxies. In light of recent work, these results suggest that the host galaxies of AGN at these X-ray luminosities may be in a transition from disk-dominated to bulge-dominated, but that this transition is not typically triggered by major mergers.

@article{Schawinski:2009zr,
  abstract = {The growth of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies are thought to be linked, but the precise nature of this symbiotic relationship is still poorly understood. Both observations and simulations of galaxy formation suggest that the energy input from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), as the central supermassive black hole accretes material and grows, heats the interstellar material and suppresses star formation. In this Letter, we show that most host galaxies of moderate-luminosity supermassive black holes in the local universe have intermediate optical colors that imply the host galaxies are transitioning from star formation to quiescence, the first time this has been shown to be true for all AGNs independent of obscuration. The intermediate colors suggest that star formation in the host galaxies ceased roughly 100 Myr ago. This result indicates that either the AGNs are very long lived, accreting for more than 1 Gyr beyond the end of star formation, or there is a ~100 Myr time delay between the shutdown of star formation and detectable black hole growth. The first explanation is unlikely given current estimates for AGN lifetimes, so low-luminosity AGNs must shut down star formation before substantial black hole accretion activity is detected. The scarcity of AGN host galaxies in the blue cloud reported here challenges scenarios where significant star formation and black hole growth are coeval. Lastly, these observations also strongly support the Unified Model of AGNs as the host galaxy colors are independent of obscuration toward the central engine.},

  abstract = {We explore the connection between different classes of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the evolution of their host galaxies, by deriving host galaxy properties, clustering, and Eddington ratios of AGNs selected in the radio, X-ray, and infrared (IR) wavebands. We study a sample of 585 AGNs at 0.25 < z < 0.8 using redshifts from the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey (AGES). We select AGNs with observations in the radio at 1.4 GHz from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, X-rays from the Chandra XBo{\"o}tes Survey, and mid-IR from the Spitzer IRAC Shallow Survey. The radio, X-ray, and IR AGN samples show only modest overlap, indicating that to the flux limits of the survey, they represent largely distinct classes of AGNs. We derive host galaxy colors and luminosities, as well as Eddington ratios, for obscured or optically faint AGNs. We also measure the two-point cross-correlation between AGNs and galaxies on scales of 0.3-10 h -1 Mpc, and derive typical dark matter halo masses. We find that: (1) radio AGNs are mainly found in luminous red sequence galaxies, are strongly clustered (with M halo ~ 3 × 1013 h -1 M sun), and have very low Eddington ratios lambda lsim 10-3 (2) X-ray-selected AGNs are preferentially found in galaxies that lie in the green valley of color-magnitude space and are clustered similar to the typical AGES galaxies (M halo ~ 1013 h -1 M sun), with 10-3 lsim lambda lsim 1; (3) IR AGNs reside in slightly bluer, slightly less luminous galaxies than X-ray AGNs, are weakly clustered (M halo lsim 1012 h -1 M sun), and have lambda>10-2. We interpret these results in terms of a simple model of AGN and galaxy evolution, whereby a quasar phase and the growth of the stellar bulge occurs when a galaxy's dark matter halo reaches a critical mass between ~1012 and 1013 M sun. After this event, star formation ceases and AGN accretion shifts from radiatively efficient (optical- and IR-bright) to radiatively inefficient (optically faint, radio-bright) modes.},

@article{Hopkins:2009rt,
  abstract = {We use the observed distribution of Eddington ratios as a function of supermassive black hole (BH) mass to constrain models of quasar/active galactic nucleus (AGN) lifetimes and light curves. Given the observed (well constrained) AGN luminosity function, a particular model for AGN light curves L(t) or, equivalently, the distribution of AGN lifetimes (time above a given luminosity t(>L)) translates directly and uniquely (without further assumptions) to a predicted distribution of Eddington ratios at each BH mass. Models for self-regulated BH growth, in which feedback produces a self-regulating decay or blowout phase after the AGN reaches some peak luminosity/BH mass and begins to expel gas and shut down accretion, make specific predictions for the light curves/lifetimes, distinct from, e.g., the expected distribution if AGN simply shut down by gas starvation (without feedback) and very different from the prediction of simple phenomenological light bulb scenarios. We show that the present observations of the Eddington ratio distribution, spanning nearly 5 orders of magnitude in Eddington ratio, 3 orders of magnitude in BH mass, and redshifts z = 0-1, agree well with the predictions of self-regulated models, and rule out phenomenological light bulb or pure exponential models, as well as gas starvation models, at high significance (~5sigma). We also compare with observations of the distribution of Eddington ratios at a given AGN luminosity, and find similar good agreement (but show that these observations are much less constraining). We fit the functional form of the quasar lifetime distribution and provide these fits for use, and show how the Eddington ratio distributions place precise, tight limits on the AGN lifetimes at various luminosities, in agreement with model predictions. We compare with independent estimates of episodic lifetimes and use this to constrain the shape of the typical AGN light curve, and provide simple analytic fits to these for use in other analyses. Given these constraints, the average local BH must have gained its mass in no more than a couple of bright, near peak-luminosity episodes, in agreement with models of accretion triggering in interactions and mergers.},

@article{Smolcic:2009vn,
  abstract = {Radio outflows of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are invoked in cosmological models as a key feedback mechanism in the latest phases of massive galaxy formation. Recently, it has been suggested that the two major radio AGN populations---the powerful high-excitation, and the weak low-excitation radio AGNs (HERAGN and LERAGN, respectively)---represent two earlier and later stages of massive galaxy buildup. To test this, here we make use of a local (0.04 < z < 0.1) sample of ~500 radio AGNs with available optical spectroscopy, drawn from the FIRST, NVSS, SDSS, and 3CRR surveys. A clear dichotomy is found between the properties of low-excitation (absorption line AGN and LINERs) and high-excitation (Seyferts) radio AGNs. The hosts of the first have the highest stellar masses, reddest optical colors, and highest mass black holes but accrete inefficiently (at low rates). On the other hand, the high-excitation radio AGNs have lower stellar masses, bluer optical colors (consistent with the green valley), and lower mass black holes that accrete efficiently (at high rates). Such properties can be explained if these two radio AGN populations represent different stages in the formation of massive galaxies, and thus are also linked to different phases of the AGN feedback.},

  abstract = {We use morphological information of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) hosts to set limits on the fraction of the accretion density of the Universe at z ~ 1 that is not likely to be associated with major mergers. Deep X-ray observations are combined with high-resolution optical data from the Hubble Space Telescope in the All-wavelength Extended Groth strip International Survey, Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) North and GOODS South fields to explore the morphological breakdown of X-ray sources in the redshift interval 0.5 < z < 1.3. The sample is split into discs, early-type bulge-dominated galaxies, peculiar systems and point sources in which the nuclear source outshines the host galaxy. The X-ray luminosity function and luminosity density of AGN at z ~ 1 are then calculated as a function of morphological type. We find that disc-dominated hosts contribute 30 +/- 9 per cent to the total AGN space density and 23 +/- 6 per cent to the luminosity density at z ~ 1. We argue that AGN in disc galaxies are most likely fuelled not by major merger events but by minor interactions or internal instabilities. We find evidence that these mechanisms may be more efficient in producing luminous AGN compared to predictions for the stochastic fuelling of massive black holes in disc galaxies.},

@article{Lutz:2010kx,
  abstract = {We study the co-existence of star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in Chandra X-ray-selected AGN by analyzing stacked 870 mum submillimeter emission from a deep and wide map of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (ECDFS), obtained with the LABOCA instrument at the APEX telescope. The total X-ray sample of 895 sources with median redshift z ~ 1 drawn from the combined (E)CDFS X-ray catalogs is detected at >11sigma significance at a mean submillimeter flux of 0.49 $\pm$ 0.04 mJy, corresponding to a typical star formation rate (SFR) around 30 M sun yr-1 for a T = 35 K, beta = 1.5 graybody far-infrared spectral energy distribution. The good signal-to-noise ratio permits stacking analyses for major subgroups, splitting the sample by redshift, intrinsic luminosity, and AGN obscuration properties. We observe a trend of SFR increasing with redshift. An increase of SFR with AGN luminosity is indicated at the highest L 2-10 keV >~ 1044 erg s-1 luminosities only. Increasing trends with X-ray obscuration as expected in some AGN evolutionary scenarios are not observed for the bulk of the X-ray AGN sample but may be present for the highest intrinsic luminosity objects with L 2-10 keV >~ 1044 erg s-1. This behavior suggests a transition between two modes in the co-existence of AGN activity and star formation. For the bulk of the sample, the X-ray luminosity and obscuration of the AGN are not intimately linked to the global SFR of their hosts. The hosts are likely massive and forming stars secularly, at rates similar to the pervasive star formation seen in massive galaxies without an AGN at similar redshifts. In these systems, star formation is not linked to a specific state of the AGN and the period of moderately luminous AGN activity may not highlight a major evolutionary transition of the galaxy. The change indicated toward more intense star formation, and a more pronounced increase in SFRs between unobscured and obscured AGN reported in the literature at highest (L 2-10 keV >~ 1044 erg s-1) luminosities suggests that these luminous AGNs follow an evolutionary path on which obscured AGN activity and intense star formation are linked, possibly via merging. Comparison to local hard X-ray-selected AGN supports this interpretation. SFRs in the hosts of moderate luminosity AGN at z ~ 1 are an order of magnitude higher than at z ~ 0, following the increase in the non-AGN massive galaxy population. At high AGN luminosities, hosts on the evolutionary link/merger path emerge from this secular level of star formation.},

@article{Xue:2010fj,
  abstract = {We extend color-magnitude relations for moderate-luminosity X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts and non-AGN galaxies through the galaxy formation epoch (z ≈ 1-4) in the Chandra Deep Field-North and Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-N and CDF-S, respectively; jointly CDFs) surveys. This study was enabled by the deepest available X-ray data from the 2 Ms CDF surveys as well as complementary ultradeep multiwavelength data in these regions. We utilized analyses of color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) to assess the role of moderate-luminosity AGNs in galaxy evolution. First, we confirm some previous results and extend them to higher redshifts, finding, for example, that (1) there is no apparent color bimodality (i.e., the lack of an obvious red sequence and blue cloud) for AGN hosts from z ≈ 0to2, but non-AGN galaxy color bimodality exists up to z ≈ 3 and the relative fraction of red-sequence galaxies generally increases as the redshift decreases (consistent with a blue-to-red migration of galaxies), (2) most AGNs reside in massive hosts and the AGN fraction rises strongly toward higher stellar mass, up to z ≈ 2-3, and (3) the colors of both AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies become redder as the stellar mass increases, up to z ≈ 2-3. Second, we point out that, in order to obtain a complete and reliable picture, it is critical to use mass-matched samples to examine color-magnitude relations of AGN hosts and non-AGN galaxies. We show that for mass-matched samples up to z ≈ 2-3, AGN hosts lie in the same region of the CMD as non-AGN galaxies; i.e., there is no specific clustering of AGN hosts in the CMD around the red sequence, the top of the blue cloud, or the green valley in between. The AGN fraction (≈ 10%) is mostly independent of host-galaxy color, providing an indication of the duty cycle of supermassive black hole growth in typical massive galaxies. These results are in contrast to those obtained with non-mass-matched samples where there is apparent AGN clustering in the CMD and the AGN fraction generally increases as the color becomes redder. We also find, for mass-matched samples, that the star formation rates of AGN hosts are typically a factor of ≈ 2-3 larger than those of non-AGN galaxies at z ≈ 0-1, whereas this difference diminishes at z ≈ 1-3. With mass-selection effects taken into account, we find that almost all of the results obtained in this work can reasonably be explained by two main ingredients, color-mass correlation (i.e., X-ray AGNs preferentially reside in massive galaxies that generally tend to be redder than less-massive galaxies) and passive or secular evolution of galaxies. Our results show that the presence of moderate-luminosity AGN activity does not have a significant effect on the colors of galaxies and thus tightly constrain any effects from moderate-luminosity AGN feedback upon color-magnitude properties over the ≈ 80% of cosmic time during which most of galaxy formation occurred.},

@article{Cardamone:2010uq,
  abstract = {Using new, highly accurate photometric redshifts from the MUSYC medium-band survey in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDF-S), we fit synthetic stellar population models to compare active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxies to inactive galaxies at 0.8 <= z <= 1.2. We find that AGN host galaxies are predominantly massive galaxies on the red sequence and in the green valley of the color-mass diagram. Because both passive and dusty galaxies can appear red in optical colors, we use rest-frame near-infrared colors to separate passively evolving stellar populations from galaxies that are reddened by dust. As with the overall galaxy population, ~25% of the red AGN host galaxies and ~75% of the green AGN host galaxies have colors consistent with young stellar populations reddened by dust. The dust-corrected rest-frame optical colors are the blue colors of star-forming galaxies, which imply that these AGN hosts are not passively aging to the red sequence. At z ~ 1, AGN activity is roughly evenly split between two modes of black hole growth: the first in passively evolving host galaxies, which may be heating up the galaxy's gas and preventing future episodes of star formation, and the second in dust-reddened young galaxies, which may be ionizing the galaxy's interstellar medium and shutting down star formation.},

@article{Hainline:2012qy,
  abstract = {We use stellar population synthesis modeling to analyze the host-galaxy properties of a sample of 33 UV-selected, narrow-lined active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z ~ 2-3. In order to quantify the contribution of AGN emission to host galaxy broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs), we use the subsample of 11 AGNs with photometric coverage spanning from rest-frame UV through near-IR wavelengths. Modeling the SEDs of these objects with a linear combination of stellar population and AGN templates, we infer the effect of the AGN on derived stellar population parameters. We also estimate the typical bias in derived stellar populations for AGNs lacking rest-frame near-IR wavelength coverage, and develop a method for inferring the true host-galaxy properties. We compare AGN host-galaxy properties to those of a sample of UV-selected, star-forming non-AGNs in the same redshift range, including a subsample carefully matched in stellar mass. Although the AGNs have higher masses and star-formation rates than the full non-active sample, their stellar population properties are consistent with those of the mass-selected sample, suggesting that the presence of an AGN is not connected with the cessation of star formation activity in star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2-3. We suggest that a correlation between M BH and galaxy stellar mass is already in place at this epoch. Assuming a roughly constant Eddington ratio for AGNs at all stellar masses, we are unable to detect the AGNs in low-mass galaxies because they are simply too faint.  Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and was made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

  abstract = {We use mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy from the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph to study the nature of star-formation and supermassive black hole accretion for a sample of 65 IR-luminous galaxies at 0.02 < z < 0.6 with F(24 mum) > 1.2 mJy. The MIR spectra cover wavelengths 5-38 mum, spanning the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features and important atomic diagnostic lines. Our sample of galaxies corresponds to a range of total IR luminosity, L IR = L(8-1000 mum) = 1010-1012 L &sun; (median L IR of 3.0 × 1011 L &sun;). We divide our sample into a subsample of galaxies with Spitzer Infrared Array Camera 3.6-8.0 mum colors indicative of warm dust heated by an active galactic nucleus (AGN; IRAGN) and those galaxies whose colors indicate star-formation processes (non-IRAGN). Compared to the non-IRAGN, the IRAGN show smaller PAH emission equivalent widths, which we attribute to an increase in mid-IR continuum from the AGN. We find that in both the IRAGN and star-forming samples, the luminosity in the PAH features correlates strongly with [Ne II] lambda12.8 mum emission line, from which we conclude that the PAH luminosity directly traces the instantaneous star-formation rate (SFR) in both the IRAGN and star-forming galaxies. We compare the ratio of PAH luminosity to the total IR luminosity, and we show that for most IRAGN star-formation accounts for 10%-50% of the total IR luminosity. We also find no measurable difference between the PAH luminosity ratios of L 11.3/L 7.7 and L 6.2/L 7.7 for the IRAGN and non-IRAGN, suggesting that AGN do not significantly excite or destroy PAH molecules on galaxy-wide scales. Interestingly, a small subset of galaxies (8 of 65 galaxies) show a strong excess of [O IV] lambda25.9 mum emission compared to their PAH emission, which indicates the presence of heavily-obscured AGN, including 3 galaxies that are not otherwise selected as IRAGN. The low PAH emission and low [Ne II] emission of the IRAGN and [O IV]-excess objects imply the IR luminosity of these objects is dominated by processes associated with the AGN. Because these galaxies lie in the green valley of the optical color-magnitude relation and have low implied SFRs, we argue their hosts have declining SFRs and these objects will transition to the red sequence unless some process restarts their star-formation.},

@article{Hernan-Caballero:2014lr,
  abstract = {We analyse the stellar populations in the host galaxies of 53 X-ray selected optically dull active galactic nuclei (AGN) at 0.34<z<1.07 with ultra-deep (m=26.5) optical medium-band (R~50) photometry from the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS). The spectral resolution of SHARDS allows us to consistently measure the strength of the 4000 AA break, Dn(4000), a reliable age indicator for stellar populations. We confirm that most X-ray selected moderate-luminosity AGN (L_X<10^44 erg/s) are hosted by massive galaxies (typically M*>10^10.5 M_sun) and that the observed fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN increases with the stellar mass. A careful selection of random control samples of inactive galaxies allows us to remove the stellar mass and redshift dependencies of the AGN fraction to explore trends with several stellar age indicators. We find no significant differences in the distribution of the rest-frame U-V colour for AGN hosts and inactive galaxies, in agreement with previous results. However, we find significantly shallower 4000 AA breaks in AGN hosts, indicative of younger stellar populations. With the help of a model-independent determination of the extinction, we obtain extinction-corrected U-V colours and light-weighted average stellar ages. We find that AGN hosts have younger stellar populations and higher extinction compared to inactive galaxies with the same stellar mass and at the same redshift. We find a highly significant excess of AGN hosts with Dn(4000)~1.4 and light weighted average stellar ages of 300-500 Myr, as well as a deficit of AGN in intrinsic red galaxies. We interpret failure in recognising these trends in previous studies as a consequence of the balancing effect in observed colours of the age-extinction degeneracy.},

@article{Bundy:2008fk,
  abstract = {Using Chandra X-ray observations in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS) we identify 241 X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs; L2-10>1042 ergs s-1) and study the properties of their host galaxies in the range 0.4<z<1.4. By making use of infrared photometry from the Palomar Observatory and BRI imaging from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we estimate AGN host galaxy stellar masses and show that both stellar mass and photometric redshift estimates (where necessary) are robust to the possible contamination from AGNs in our X-ray-selected sample. Accounting for the photometric and X-ray sensitivity limits of the survey, we construct the stellar mass function of X-ray-selected AGN host galaxies and find that their abundance decreases by a factor of ~2 since z~1 but remains roughly flat as a function of stellar mass. We compare the abundance of AGN hosts to the rate of star formation quenching observed in the total galaxy population. If the timescale for X-ray-detectable AGN activity is roughly 0.5-1 Gyr, as suggested by black hole demographics and recent simulations, then we deduce that the inferred AGN ``trigger'' rate matches the star formation quenching rate, suggesting a link between these phenomena. However, given the large range of nuclear accretion rates we infer for the most massive and red hosts, X-ray-selected AGNs may not be directly responsible for quenching star formation.},

@article{Fanidakis:2012lr,
  abstract = {We use a coupled model of the formation and evolution of galaxies and black holes (BHs) to study the evolution of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in a cold dark matter universe. The model is embedded in the galaxy formation code GALFORM and predicts the masses, spins and mass accretion histories of BHs in tandem with the formation of their host galaxies. BHs grow by accretion during starbursts, triggered by discs becoming dynamically unstable or by galaxy mergers, and accretion from quasi-hydrostatic hot gas haloes. Using an empirical law for AGN obscuration, our model matches the observed luminosity functions (LFs) of AGNs over a wide range of redshifts. Due to the suppression of cooling in massive haloes by AGN feedback, at low redshift (z≲ 2), the brightest quasars (Lbol≳ 1046 erg s-1) are predicted preferentially to inhabit haloes with masses ?. The model predicts a hierarchical buildup of BH mass, with the typical mass of actively growing BHs increasing with decreasing redshift. Nevertheless, the model displays clear 'downsizing' as reflected in the differential evolution of the space density of faint and bright AGNs. This arises naturally from the interplay between the starburst and hot gas halo accretion modes. The faint end of the LF is dominated by massive BHs accreting at low rates via a thick disc, primarily during the hot-halo mode. The bright end is populated by BHs accreting close to or above the Eddington limit during the starburst mode. Obscuration plays a central role in determining the observed abundance of AGNs and, hence, in their implied cosmic evolution.},

@article{Hickox:2014yq,
  abstract = {We investigate the effect of active galactic nucleus (AGN) variability on the observed connection between star formation and black hole accretion in extragalactic surveys. Recent studies have reported relatively weak correlations between observed AGN luminosities and the properties of AGN hosts, which has been interpreted to imply that there is no direct connection between AGN activity and star formation. However, AGNs may be expected to vary significantly on a wide range of timescales (from hours to Myr) that are far shorter than the typical timescale for star formation (gsim100 Myr). This variability can have important consequences for observed correlations. We present a simple model in which all star-forming galaxies host an AGN when averaged over ~100 Myr timescales, with long-term average AGN accretion rates that are perfectly correlated with the star formation rate (SFR). We show that reasonable prescriptions for AGN variability reproduce the observed weak correlations between SFR and L AGN in typical AGN host galaxies, as well as the general trends in the observed AGN luminosity functions, merger fractions, and measurements of the average AGN luminosity as a function of SFR. These results imply that there may be a tight connection between AGN activity and SFR over galaxy evolution timescales, and that the apparent similarities in rest-frame colors, merger rates, and clustering of AGNs compared to inactive galaxies may be due primarily to AGN variability. The results provide motivation for future deep, wide extragalactic surveys that can measure the distribution of AGN accretion rates as a function of SFR.},

  abstract = {The parameterized extinction data of Fitzpatrick and Massa (1986, 1988) for the ultraviolet and various sources for the optical and near-infrared are used to derive a meaningful average extinction law over the 3.5 micron to 0.125 wavelength range which is applicable to both diffuse and dense regions of the interstellar medium. The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

  abstract = {We present measurements of dust reddening using the colors of stars with spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 56, 34, 25, and 29 mmag in the colors u - g, g - r, r - i, and i - z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier blue tip reddening measurements, finding reddening coefficients different by -3%, 1%, 1%, and 2% in u - g, g - r, r - i, and i - z from those found by the blue tip method, after removing a 4% normalization difference. These results prefer an RV = 3.1 Fitzpatrick reddening law to O'Donnell or Cardelli et al. reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al. (SFD) maps of E(B - V) to extinction in 88 bandpasses for four values of RV , using this reddening law and the 14% recalibration of SFD first reported by Schlafly et al. and confirmed in this work.},

GALEX is performing the first space UV sky survey, including imaging and grism surveys in two bands (1350-1750 and 1750-2750 {\AA}). The surveys include an all-sky imaging survey (mAB~=20.5), a medium imaging survey of 1000 deg2 (mAB~=23), a deep imaging survey of 100 deg2 (mAB~=25), and a nearby galaxy survey. Spectroscopic (slitless) grism surveys (R=100-200) are underway with various depths and sky coverage. Many targets overlap existing or planned surveys in other bands. We will use the measured UV properties of local galaxies, along with corollary observations, to calibrate the relationship of the UV and global star formation rate in local galaxies. We will apply this calibration to distant galaxies discovered in the deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys to map the history of star formation in the universe over the redshift range 0<z<2 and probe the physical drivers of star formation in galaxies. The GALEX mission includes a guest investigator program, supporting the wide variety of programs made possible by the first UV sky survey.},

@article{Bianchi:2014qy,
  abstract = {The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) has performed the first surveys of the sky in the ultraviolet (UV). Its legacy is an unprecedented database with more than 200 million source measurements in far-UV (FUV) and near-UV (NUV), as well as wide-field imaging of extended objects, filling an important gap in our view of the sky across the electromagnetic spectrum. The UV surveys offer unique sensitivity for identifying and studying selected classes of astrophysical objects, both stellar and extra-galactic. We examine the overall content and distribution of UV sources over the sky, and with magnitude and color. For this purpose, we have constructed final catalogs of UV sources with homogeneous quality, eliminating duplicate measurements of the same source. Such catalogs can facilitate a variety of investigations on UV-selected samples, as well as planning of observations with future missions. We describe the criteria used to build the catalogs, their coverage and completeness. We included observations in which both the far-UV and near-UV detectors were exposed; 28,707 fields from the All-Sky Imaging survey (AIS) cover a unique area of 22,080 square degrees (after we restrict the catalogues to the central 1$\,^{\circ}$ diameter of the field), with a typical depth of ~20/21mag (FUV/NUV, in the AB mag system), and 3008 fields from the Medium-depth Imaging Survey (MIS) cover a total of 2251 square degrees at a depth of ~22.7mag. The catalogs contain ~71 and ~16.6 million sources, respectively. The density of hot stars reflects the Galactic structure, and the number counts of both Galactic and extra-galactic sources are modulated by the Milky Way dust extinction, to which the UV data are very sensitive.},

Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.},

@article{Chary:2001lr,
  abstract = {The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at lambda>5 mum and the galaxy counts from various surveys at mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic background at lambda>200 mum is quite sensitive to the evolution at high redshift, i.e., z>1, all models that fit the counts require a flattening at z~0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80% of the 140 mum CIRB is produced at 0<z<1.5, while only about 30% of the 850 mum background is produced within the same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z=0.8+/-0.1, much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25+0.12-0.1 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, and remains almost constant up to z~2. At least 70% of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with LIR>1011 Lsolar. The long-wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly trace the evolution at z>2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts. However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the Lyman break galaxy population at z~3 suggests that the almost flat comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a redshift of z~4.},

@article{Remy-Ruyer:2013kx,
  abstract = {Context. We present new photometric data from our Herschel guaranteed time key programme, the Dwarf Galaxy Survey (DGS), dedicated to the observation of the gas and dust in low-metallicity environments. A total of 48 dwarf galaxies were observed with the PACS and SPIRE instruments onboard the Herschel Space Observatory at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mum.  Aims: The goal of this paper is to provide reliable far-infrared (FIR) photometry for the DGS sample and to analyse the FIR/submillimetre (submm) behaviour of the DGS galaxies. We focus on a systematic comparison of the derived FIR properties (FIR luminosity, LFIR, dust mass, Mdust, dust temperature, T, emissivity index, beta) with more metal-rich galaxies and investigate the detection of a potential submm excess.  Methods: The data reduction method is adapted for each galaxy in order to derive the most reliable photometry from the final maps. The derived PACS flux densities are compared with the Spitzer MIPS 70 and 160 mum bands. We use colour-colour diagrams to analyse the FIR/submm behaviour of the DGS galaxies and modified blackbody fitting procedures to determine their dust properties. To study the variation in these dust properties with metallicity, we also include galaxies from the Herschel KINGFISH sample, which contains more metal-rich environments, totalling 109 galaxies.  Results: The location of the DGS galaxies on Herschel colour-colour diagrams highlights the differences in dust grain properties and/or global environments of low-metallicity dwarf galaxies. The dust in DGS galaxies is generally warmer than in KINGFISH galaxies (TDGS ~ 32 K and TKINGFISH ~ 23 K). The emissivity index, beta, is ~1.7 in the DGS, however metallicity does not make a strong effect on beta. The proportion of dust mass relative to stellar mass is lower in low-metallicity galaxies: Mdust/Mstar ~ 0.02% for the DGS versus 0.1% for KINGFISH. However, per unit dust mass, dwarf galaxies emit about six times more in the FIR/submm than higher metallicity galaxies. Out of the 22 DGS galaxies detected at 500 mum, about 41% present an excess in the submm beyond the explanation of our dust SED model, and this excess can go up to 150% above the prediction from the model. The excess mainly appears in lower metallicity galaxies (12 + log(O/H) ≲ 8.3), and the strongest excesses are detected in the most metal-poor galaxies. However, we also stress the need for observations longwards of the Herschel wavelengths to detect any submm excess appearing beyond 500 mum.

@article{Smith:2012fj,
  abstract = {We present an analysis of the dust and gas in Andromeda, using Herschel images sampling the entire far-infrared peak. We fit a modified-blackbody model to ~4000 quasi-independent pixels with spatial resolution of ~140 pc and find that a variable dust-emissivity index (beta) is required to fit the data. We find no significant long-wavelength excess above this model, suggesting there is no cold dust component. We show that the gas-to-dust ratio varies radially, increasing from ~20 in the center to ~70 in the star-forming ring at 10 kpc, consistent with the metallicity gradient. In the 10 kpc ring the average beta is ~1.9, in good agreement with values determined for the Milky Way (MW). However, in contrast to the MW, we find significant radial variations in beta, which increases from 1.9 at 10 kpc to ~2.5 at a radius of 3.1 kpc and then decreases to 1.7 in the center. The dust temperature is fairly constant in the 10 kpc ring (ranging from 17 to 20 K), but increases strongly in the bulge to ~30 K. Within 3.1 kpc we find the dust temperature is highly correlated with the 3.6 mum flux, suggesting the general stellar population in the bulge is the dominant source of dust heating there. At larger radii, there is a weak correlation between the star formation rate and dust temperature. We find no evidence for dark gas in M31 in contrast to recent results for the MW. Finally, we obtained an estimate of the CO X-factor by minimizing the dispersion in the gas-to-dust ratio, obtaining a value of (1.9 $\pm$ 0.4) × 1020 cm-2 [K km s-1]-1.

@article{Galametz:2012uq,
  abstract = {Taking advantage of the unprecedented combination of sensitivity and angular resolution afforded by the Herschel Space Observatory at far-infrared and submillimetre wavelengths, we aim to characterize the physical properties of cold dust within nearby galaxies, as well as the associated uncertainties, namely the robustness of the parameters we derive using different modified blackbody models. For a pilot subsample of the KINGFISH (Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel) key programme, we perform two-temperature fits of the Spitzer and Herschel photometric data (from 24 to 500 mum), with a warm and a cold component, both globally and in each resolution element. We compare the results obtained from different analysis strategies. At global scale, we observe a range of values of the modified blackbody fit parameters betac (0.8-2.5) and Tc (19.1-25.1 K). We compute maps of our modelling parameters with betac fixed or treated as a free parameter to test the robustness of the temperature and dust surface density maps we deduce. When the emissivity is fixed, we observe steeper temperature gradients as a function of radius than when it is allowed to vary. When the emissivity is fitted as a free parameter, barred galaxies tend to have uniform fitted emissivities. Gathering the parameters obtained in each resolution element in a Tc-betac diagram underlines an anticorrelation between the two parameters. It remains difficult to assess whether the dominant effect is the physics of dust grains, noise, or mixing along the line of sight and in the beam. We finally observe in both cases that the dust column density peaks in central regions of galaxies and bar-ends (coinciding with molecular gas density enhancements usually found in these locations). We also quantify how the total dust mass varies with our assumptions about the emissivity index as well as the influence of the wavelength coverage used in the fits. We show that modified blackbody fits using a shallow emissivity (beta < 2.0) lead to significantly lower dust masses compared to the beta < 2.0 case, with dust masses lower by up to 50 per cent if betac = 1.5, for instance. The working resolution affects our total dust mass estimates: masses increase from global fits to spatially resolved fits.},

@article{Gordon:2010qy,
  abstract = {Context. The properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derived from fitting far-IR SEDs (>=100 mum). Only with SPIRE on Herschel has it been possible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 mum that is beyond the peak (~160 mum) of dust emission in most galaxies.  Aims: We investigate the differences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only <200 mum data and then also including >200 mum data (new SPIRE observations) to determine how important having >200 mum data is for deriving these dust properties.  Methods: We fit the 100 to 350 mum observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) point-by-point with a model that consists of a single temperature and fixed emissivity law. The data used are existing observations at 100 and 160 mum (from IRAS and Spitzer) and new SPIRE observations of 1/4 of the LMC observed for the HERITAGE key project as part of the Herschel science demonstration phase.  Results: The dust temperatures and masses computed using only 100 and 160 mum data can differ by up to 10% and 36%, respectively, from those that also include the SPIRE 250 & 350 mum data. We find that an emissivity law proportional to lambda-1.5 minimizes the 100-350 mum fractional residuals. We find that the emission at 500 mum is ~10% higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths. We find the fractional 500 mum excess is weakly anti-correlated with MIPS 24 mum flux and the total gas surface density. This argues against a flux calibration error as the origin of the 500 mum excess. Our results do not allow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelength dependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable at lambda >= 500 mum for the origin of the 500 mum excess.

@article{Dale:2007fk,
  abstract = {The ultraviolet-to-radio continuum spectral energy distributions are presented for all 75 galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). A principal component analysis of the sample shows that most of the sample's spectral variations stem from two underlying components, one representative of a galaxy with a low infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio and one representative of a galaxy with a high infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio. The influence of several parameters on the infrared-to-ultraviolet ratio is studied (e.g., optical morphology, disk inclination, far-infrared color, ultraviolet spectral slope, and star formation history). Consistent with our understanding of normal star-forming galaxies, the SINGS sample of galaxies in comparison to more actively star-forming galaxies exhibits a larger dispersion in the infrared-to-ultraviolet versus ultraviolet spectral slope correlation. Early-type galaxies, exhibiting low star formation rates and high optical surface brightnesses, have the most discrepant infrared-to-ultraviolet correlation. These results suggest that the star formation history may be the dominant regulator of the broadband spectral variations between galaxies. Finally, a new discovery shows that the 24 mum morphology can be a useful tool for parameterizing the global dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction in nearby galaxies. The dust emission in dwarf/irregular galaxies is clumpy and warm accompanied by low ultraviolet extinction, while in spiral galaxies there is typically a much larger diffuse component of cooler dust and average ultraviolet extinction. For galaxies with nuclear 24 mum emission, the dust temperature and ultraviolet extinction are relatively high compared to disk galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present the submillimeter spectra from 450 to 1550 GHz of 11 nearby active galaxies observed with the SPIRE Fourier Transform Spectrometer (SPIRE/FTS) on board Herschel. We detect CO transitions from J up = 4 to 12, as well as the two [C I] fine structure lines at 492 and 809 GHz and the [N II]1461 GHz line. We used radiative transfer models to analyze the observed CO spectral line energy distributions. The FTS CO data were complemented with ground-based observations of the low-J CO lines. We found that the warm molecular gas traced by the mid-J CO transitions has similar physical conditions (n_H_2 \sim 103.2-103.9 cm-3 and T kin ~ 300-800 K) in most of our galaxies. Furthermore, we found that this warm gas is likely producing the mid-IR rotational H2 emission. We could not determine the specific heating mechanism of the warm gas, however, it is possibly related to the star formation activity in these galaxies. Our modeling of the [C I] emission suggests that it is produced in cold (T kin < 30 K) and dense (n_H_2 \gt 10^3 cm-3) molecular gas. Transitions of other molecules are often detected in our SPIRE/FTS spectra. The HF J = 1-0 transition at 1232 GHz is detected in absorption in UGC 05101 and in emission in NGC 7130. In the latter, near-infrared pumping, chemical pumping, or collisional excitation with electrons are plausible excitation mechanisms likely related to the active galactic nucleus of this galaxy. In some galaxies, few H2O emission lines are present. Additionally, three OH+ lines at 909, 971, and 1033 GHz are identified in NGC 7130.},

@article{Roussel:2013gf,
  abstract = {Scanamorphos is public software available to postprocess scan observations performed with the Herschel photometer arrays. This postprocessing mainly consists in subtracting the total low-frequency noise (both its thermal and nonthermal components), masking high-frequency artefacts such as cosmic ray hits, and projecting the data onto a map. Although it was developed for Herschel, it is also applicable with minimal adjustment to scan observations made with some other imaging arrays subjected to low-frequency noise, provided they entail sufficient redundancy; it was successfully applied to P-Art{\'e}mis, an instrument operating on the APEX telescope. Contrary to matrix-inversion softwares and high-pass filters, Scanamorphos does not assume any particular noise model, and does not apply any Fourier-space filtering to the data, but is an empirical tool using purely the redundancy built in the observations - taking advantage of the fact that each portion of the sky is sampled at multiple times by multiple bolometers. It is an interactive software in the sense that the user is allowed to optionally visualize and control results at each intermediate step, but the processing is fully automated. This paper describes the principles and algorithm of Scanamorphos and presents several examples of application.},

@article{Hao:2011qv,
  abstract = {We present new calibrations of far-ultraviolet (FUV) attenuation as derived from the total infrared to FUV luminosity ratio (IRX) and the FUV-near-UV(NUV) color. We find that the IRX-corrected FUV luminosities are tightly and linearly correlated with the attenuation-corrected Halpha luminosities (as measured from the Balmer decrement), with an rms scatter of $\pm$0.09 dex. The ratios of these attenuation-corrected FUV to Halpha luminosities are consistent with evolutionary synthesis model predictions, assuming a constant star formation rate over 100 Myr, solar metallicity, and either a Salpeter or a Kroupa initial mass function with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 100 M &sun;. The IRX-corrected FUV to Balmer-corrected Halpha luminosity ratios do not show any trend with other galactic properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. In contrast, FUV attenuation derived from the FUV-NUV color (UV spectral slope) show much larger random and systematic uncertainties. When compared to either Balmer-corrected Halpha luminosities or IRX-corrected FUV luminosities the color-corrected FUV luminosities show ~2.5 times larger rms scatter, and systematic nonlinear deviations as functions of luminosity and other parameters. Linear combinations of 25 mum and 1.4 GHz radio continuum luminosities with the observed FUV luminosities are also well correlated with the Balmer-corrected Halpha luminosities. These results provide useful prescriptions for deriving attenuation-corrected star formation rates of galaxies based on linear combinations of UV and IR or radio luminosities, which are presented in convenient tabular form. Comparisons of our calibrations with attenuation corrections in the literature and with dust attenuation laws are also made.},

@article{Shi:2006xy,
  abstract = {We describe observations of 9.7 mum silicate features in 97 AGNs, exhibiting a wide range of AGN types and of X-ray extinction toward the central nuclei. We find that the strength of the silicate feature correlates with the H I column density estimated from fitting the X-ray data, such that low H I columns correspond to silicate emission, while high columns correspond to silicate absorption. The behavior is generally consistent with unification models in which the large diversity in AGN properties is caused by viewing-angle-dependent obscuration of the nucleus. Radio-loud AGNs and radio-quiet quasars follow roughly the correlation between H I columns and the strength of the silicate feature defined by Seyfert galaxies. The agreement among AGN types suggests a high-level unification with similar characteristics for the structure of the obscuring material. We demonstrate the implications for unification models qualitatively with a conceptual disk model. The model includes an inner accretion disk (<0.1 pc in radius), a middle disk (0.1-10 pc in radius) with a dense diffuse component and with embedded denser clouds, and an outer clumpy disk (10-300 pc in radius).},

@article{Siebenmorgen:2005jk,
  abstract = {According to the unified scheme, AGN are surrounded by a dust-torus, and the observed diversity of AGN properties results from the different orientations relative to our line of sight. The strong resonance of silicate dust at 10 mum is therefore, as expected, seen in absorption towards many type-2 AGN. In type-1 AGN, it should be seen in emission because the hot inner surface of the dust torus becomes visible. However, this has not been observed so far, thus challenging the unification scheme or leading to exotic modifications of the dust-torus model. Here we report the discovery of the 10 mum silicate feature in emission in two luminous quasars with the Infrared Spectrograph of the Spitzer Space Telescope.},

  abstract = {We report the spectroscopic detection of silicate emission at 10 and 18 mum in five PG quasars, the first detection of these two features in galaxies outside the Local Group. This finding is consistent with the unification model for active galactic nuclei (AGNs), which predicts that an AGN torus seen pole-on should show a silicate emission feature in the mid-infrared. The strengths of the detected silicate emission features range from 0.12 to 1.25 times the continuum at 10 mum and from 0.20 to 0.79 times the continuum at 18 mum. The silicate grain temperatures inferred from the ratio of 18 mum to 10 mum silicate features under the assumption of optically thin emission range from 140 to 220 K.},

  abstract = {A sample of 196 AGNs and ULIRGs observed by the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on Spitzer is analyzed to study the distribution of the strength of the 9.7 mum silicate feature. Average spectra are derived for quasars, Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 AGNs, and ULIRGs. We find that quasars are characterized by silicate features in emission and Seyfert 1s equally by emission or weak absorption. Seyfert 2s are dominated by weak silicate absorption, and ULIRGs are characterized by strong silicate absorption (mean apparent optical depth about 1.5). Luminosity distributions show that luminosities at rest frame 5.5 mum are similar for the most luminous quasars and ULIRGs and are almost 105 times more luminous than the least luminous AGN in the sample. The distributions of spectral characteristics and luminosities are compared to those of optically faint infrared sources at z~2 being discovered by the IRS, which are also characterized by strong silicate absorption. It is found that local ULIRGs are a similar population, although they have lower luminosities and somewhat stronger absorption compared to the high-redshift sources.},

@article{Sturm:2006kq,
  abstract = {We have performed a spectroscopic study of seven Type 2 QSOs using the mid-infrared spectrometer IRS on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. These are (to our knowledge) the first mid-IR spectra of X-ray-selected QSO2s taken. The objects have been selected according to their high intrinsic luminosities and column densities in X-rays. Their spectra strongly differ from template spectra of Type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at lower luminosities. They do not exhibit strong PAH dust emission features from circumnuclear star-forming regions, typical for lower luminosity Type 2 Seyfert galaxies or other previously used QSO2 templates, such as the (ultra)luminous infrared galaxy ([U]LIRG) NGC 6240. They also do not show the ice and silicate absorption features of highly luminous but deeply embedded compact nuclei seen in some ULIRGs. Instead, they reveal a relatively featureless, rising continuum similar to luminous Type 1 AGNs. We also find evidence for a 10 mum silicate feature in  emission. Models of dusty tori in the AGN unification scenario predict this only for Type 1 AGNs. The ratio of the AGN continuum luminosity at 6 mum to the absorption-corrected 2-10 keV X-ray AGN luminosity is very similar to that found in Seyfert galaxies. X-ray-selected QSO2s are thus characterized by powerful AGNs in hosts with a luminosity due to star formation <~1011 Lsolar. The dominance of the AGN light in the mid-IR spectra of QSO2s together with their flatter spectral energy distributions (SEDs) places important constraints on models of the cosmic infrared background and of the star formation history of the universe.},

  abstract = {The unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) predicts silicate emission features at 10 and 18 mum in type 1 AGNs, and such features have now been observed in objects ranging from distant quasi-stellar objects to nearby LINERs. More surprising, however, is the detection of silicate emission in a few type 2 AGNs. By combining Gemini and Spitzer mid-infrared imaging and spectroscopy of NGC 2110, the closest known Seyfert 2 galaxy with silicate emission features, we can constrain the location of the silicate-emitting region to within 32 pc of the nucleus. This is the strongest constraint yet on the size of the silicate-emitting region in a Seyfert galaxy of any type. While this result is consistent with a narrow-line region origin for the emission, comparison with clumpy torus models demonstrates that emission from an edge-on torus can also explain the silicate emission features and 2-20 mum spectral energy distribution of this object. In many of the best-fitting models the torus has only a small number of clouds along the line of sight, and does not extend far above the equatorial plane. Extended silicate-emitting regions may well be present in AGNs, but this work establishes that emission from the torus itself is also a viable option for the origin of silicate emission features in active galaxies of both type 1 and type 2.},

A long-standing issue is the relation between star formation and the fueling of the supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We compile a sample of 57 Seyfert galaxies to tackle this issue. We estimate the surface densities of gas and star formation rates in circumnuclear regions (CNRs). Comparing them with the well-known Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) law, we find that the star formation rates (SFRs) in the CNRs of most Seyfert galaxies are suppressed in this sample. Feedback is suggested to explain the suppressed SFRs.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the host properties of 85 224 emission-line galaxies selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that Seyferts and low-ionization narrow emission-line regions (LINERs) form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite active galactic nucleus-HII (AGN-HII) galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty, less concentrated, and they have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies have. Seyferts and LINERs are most strongly distinguished by their [OIII] luminosities. We then consider the quantity L[OIII]/sigma4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[OIII]/sigma4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/LEDD and Seyferts dominant at high L/LEDD. These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than required by Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.},

  abstract = {We examine the properties of the host galaxies of 22 623 narrow-line active galactic nuclei (AGN) with 0.02 < z < 0.3 selected from a complete sample of 122 808 galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We focus on the luminosity of the [OIII]lambda5007 emission line as a tracer of the strength of activity in the nucleus. We study how AGN host properties compare with those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early types. The hosts of high-luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high-luminosity AGN have strong Hdelta absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and quasars (QSOs) with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

@article{Calzetti:2010cj,
  abstract = {Spitzer data at 24, 70, and 160 mum and ground-based Halpha images are analyzed for a sample of 189 nearby star-forming and starburst galaxies to investigate whether reliable star formation rate (SFR) indicators can be defined using the monochromatic infrared dust emission centered at 70 and 160 mum. We compare recently published recipes for SFR measures using combinations of the 24 mum and observed Halpha luminosities with those using 24 mum luminosity alone. From these comparisons, we derive a reference SFR indicator for use in our analysis. Linear correlations between SFR and the 70 mum and 160 mum luminosity are found for L(70) >~ 1.4 × 1042 erg s-1 and L(160) >~ 2 × 1042 erg s-1, corresponding to SFR >~ 0.1-0.3 M sun yr-1, and calibrations of SFRs based on L(70) and L(160) are proposed. Below those two luminosity limits, the relation between SFR and 70 mum (160 mum) luminosity is nonlinear and SFR calibrations become problematic. A more important limitation is the dispersion of the data around the mean trend, which increases for increasing wavelength. The scatter of the 70 mum (160 mum) data around the mean is about 25% (factor ~2) larger than the scatter of the 24 mum data. We interpret this increasing dispersion as an effect of the increasing contribution to the infrared emission of dust heated by stellar populations not associated with the current star formation. Thus, the 70 (160) mum luminosity can be reliably used to trace SFRs in large galaxy samples, but will be of limited utility for individual objects, with the exception of infrared-dominated galaxies. The nonlinear relation between SFR and the 70 and 160 mum emission at faint galaxy luminosities suggests a variety of mechanisms affecting the infrared emission for decreasing luminosity, such as increasing transparency of the interstellar medium, decreasing effective dust temperature, and decreasing filling factor of star-forming regions across the galaxy. In all cases, the calibrations hold for galaxies with oxygen abundance higher than roughly 12 +log(O/H) ~ 8.1. At lower metallicity, the infrared luminosity no longer reliably traces the SFR because galaxies are less dusty and more transparent.  Based on observations obtained with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by JPL, CalTech, under NASA Contract 1407.},

@article{Spoon:2007oq,
  abstract = {We present a new diagnostic diagram for mid-infrared spectra of infrared galaxies based on the equivalent width of the 6.2 mum PAH emission feature and the strength of the 9.7 mum silicate feature. Based on the positions in this diagram, we classify galaxies into nine classes ranging from continuum-dominated AGN hot dust spectra and PAH-dominated starburst spectra to absorption-dominated spectra of deeply obscured galactic nuclei. We find that galaxies are systematically distributed along two distinct branches: one of AGN and starburst-dominated spectra and one of deeply obscured nuclei and starburst-dominated spectra. The separation into two branches likely reflects a fundamental difference in the dust geometry in the two sets of sources: clumpy versus nonclumpy obscuration. Spectra of ULIRGs are found along the full length of both branches, reflecting the diverse nature of the ULIRG family.},

@article{Voit:1992ss,
  abstract = {Infrared spectra of dusty galactic environments often contain emission features attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons or PAHs, which can be considered to be very small grains or very large molecules. Although IR spectra of starburst galaxies almost always show these emission features, similar spectra of active galaxies are usually featureless. Even in those active galaxies that do exhibit PAH emission, the PAHs still appear to be eradicated from the nuclear region. This dichotomy suggests that PAHs are destroyed by the intense hard radiation field from an AGN. Laboratory experiments show that certain PAHs are, in fact, so effectively destroyed by individual EUV and X-ray photons that they cannot survive even at kiloparsec distances from active nuclei. Regions within active galaxies that do show PAH emission must therefore be shielded from the central X-ray source by a substantial column density of X-ray absorbing gas.},

  abstract = {ISO has shown that the mid-IR spectra of almost all sources are dominated by narrow emission features collectively known as the UIR bands. These bands are carried by a family of aromatic hydrocarbon species containing about 50 C-atoms: PAH molecules. Other molecules such as C-chains as well as non-aromatic groups attached to the PAHs are much less abundant. ISO has revealed that the UIR spectrum is incredibly rich with a large number of weaker features, subfeatures, and shoulders; many, many of which were not known before. Some examples and the new insights they can provide are described. A systematic study of this spectral structure may well allow us to considerably narrow down the composition of the family of PAHs responsible for the observed emission. These studies have made it quite clear that the universe as seen by ISO is a molecular universe.},

  abstract = {The 10 mum silicate feature observed with Spitzer in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) reveals some puzzling behavior. It (1) has been detected in emission in type 2 sources, (2) shows broad, flat-topped emission peaks shifted toward long wavelengths in several type 1 sources, and (3) is not seen in deep absorption in any source observed so far. We solve all three puzzles with our clumpy dust radiative transfer formalism. Addressing (1), we present the spectral energy distribution (SED) of SST1721+6012, the first type 2 quasar observed to show a clear 10 mum silicate feature in emission. Such emission arises in models of the AGN torus easily when its clumpy nature is taken into account. We constructed a large database of clumpy torus models and performed extensive fitting of the observed SED. We find that the cloud radial distribution varies as r -1.5 and the torus contains 2-4 clouds along radial equatorial rays, each with optical depth at visual ~60-80. The source bolometric luminosity is ~3 × 1012 Lsun. Our modeling suggests that lsim35% of objects with tori sharing these characteristics and geometry would have their central engines obscured. This relatively low obscuration probability can explain the clear appearance of the 10 mum emission feature in SST1721+6012 together with its rarity among other QSO2. Investigating (2), we also fitted the SED of PG1211+143, one of the first type 1 QSOs with a 10 mum silicate feature detected in emission. Together with other similar sources, this QSO appears to display an unusually broadened feature whose peak is shifted toward longer wavelengths. Although this led to suggestions of non-standard dust chemistry in these sources, our analysis fits such SEDs with standard galactic dust; the apparent peak shifts arise from simple radiative transfer effects. Regarding (3), we find additionally that the distribution of silicate feature strengths among clumpy torus models closely resembles the observed distribution, and the feature never occurs deeply absorbed. Comparing such distributions in several AGN samples we also show that the silicate emission feature becomes stronger in the transition from Seyfert to quasar luminosities.},

@article{Sturm:2005rq,
  abstract = {We report the first detection of ~10 and ~18 mum silicate dust emissions in a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN), obtained in Spitzer IRS 7-37 mum spectroscopy of the type 1 LINER galaxy NGC 3998. Silicate emissions in AGNs have only recently been detected in several quasars. Our detection counters suggestions that silicate emissions are present only in the most luminous AGNs. The silicate features may be signatures of a dusty ``obscuring torus'' viewed face-on as postulated for type 1 AGNs. However, the apparently cool (~200 K) dust is inconsistent with theoretical expectations of much hotter torus walls. Furthermore, not all type 1 objects are silicate emission sources. Alternatively, the silicate emission may originate in dust not directly associated with a torus. We find that the long-wavelength (>~20 mum) tail of the emission in NGC 3998 is significantly weaker than in the sample of bright QSOs recently presented by Hao et al. The 10 mum profile in our NGC 3998 spectrum is inconsistent with ``standard'' silicate ISM dust. This may indicate differences in the dust composition, grain size distribution, or degree of crystallization. The differences between NGC 3998, QSOs, and Galactic templates suggest that there are significant environmental variations.},

@article{Tommasin:2010hq,
  abstract = {We present our Spitzer-Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) spectroscopic survey from 10 mum to 37 mum of the Seyfert galaxies of the 12 mum Galaxy Sample, collected in a high-resolution mode (R ~ 600). The new spectra of 61 galaxies, together with the data we already published, give us a total of 91 12 mum Seyfert galaxies observed, out of 112. We discuss the mid-IR emission lines and features of the Seyfert galaxies, using an improved active galactic nucleus (AGN) classification scheme: instead of adopting the usual classes of Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 2's, we use the spectropolarimetric data from the literature to divide the objects into categories AGN 1 and AGN 2, where AGN 1's include all broad-line objects, including the Seyfert 2's showing hidden broad lines in polarized light. The remaining category, AGN 2's, contains only Seyferts with no detectable broad lines in either direct or polarized spectroscopy. We present various mid-IR observables, such as ionization-sensitive and density-sensitive line ratios, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) 11.25 mum feature and the H2 S(1) rotational line equivalent widths (EWs), the (60-25 mum) spectral index, and the source extendedness at 19 mum, to characterize similarities and differences in the AGN populations, in terms of AGN dominance versus star formation dominance. We find that the mid-IR emission properties characterize all the AGN 1's objects as a single family, with strongly AGN-dominated spectra. In contrast, the AGN 2's can be divided into two groups, the first one with properties similar to the AGN 1's except without detected broad lines, and the second with properties similar to the non-Seyfert galaxies, such as LINERs or starburst galaxies. We computed a semianalytical model to estimate the AGN and the starburst contributions to the mid-IR galaxy emission at 19 mum. For 59 galaxies with appropriate data, we can separate the 19 mum emission into AGN and starburst components using the measured mid-IR spectral features. We use these to quantify the brightness thresholds that an AGN must meet to satisfy our classifications: AGN 1's have an AGN contribution >=73% and AGN 2 >= 45% of their total emission at 19 mum. The detection of [Ne V] lines turns out to be an almost perfect signature of energy production by an AGN. Only four (~7.5%) of 55 AGN 1's and two (10%) out of 20 AGN 2's do not have [Ne V] 14.3 mum down to a flux limit of ~4 × 10-15 erg s-1 cm-2. We present mean spectra of the various AGN categories. Passing from AGN-dominated to starburst-dominated objects, the continuum steepens, especially at wavelengths shorter than 20 mum, while the PAH feature increases in its EW and the high ionization lines decrease. We estimate H2 mass and excitation temperature through the measurement of the S(1) rotational line of this molecule. Finally, we derive the first local luminosity functions for the brightest mid-IR lines and the PAH feature at 11.25 mum. No statistical difference is apparent in the space densities for Seyfert 1's and 2's of a given line luminosity, or for the new classes of AGN 1's and 2's. We use the correlation between [Ne V] line and nonstellar IR continuum luminosity to derive the global output of accretion-powered galactic nuclei in the local universe.},

@article{Baum:2010kh,
  abstract = {We present an analysis of Spitzer IRS spectroscopy of 83 active galaxies from the extended 12 mum sample. We find rank correlations between several tracers of star formation which suggest that (1) the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon feature is a reliable tracer of star formation, (2) there is a significant contribution to the heating of the cool dust by stars, and (3) the H2 emission is also primarily excited by star formation. The 55-90 versus 20-30 spectral index plot is also a diagnostic of the relative contribution of starburst to active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We see there is a large change in spectral index across the sample: Deltaalpha ~ 3 for both indices. Thus, the contribution to the IR spectrum from the AGN and starburst components can be comparable in magnitude but the relative contribution also varies widely across the sample. We find rank correlations between several AGN tracers. We find correlations of the ratios [O III]lambda5007/[O IV] 26 mum and [O III]lambda5007/[Ne V] 14 mum with the silicate strength which we adopt as an orientation indicator. This suggests that some of the [O III]lambda5007 emission in these Seyferts is subject to orientation dependent obscuration as found by Haas et al. for radio galaxies and quasars. There is no correlation of [Ne V] equivalent width with the silicate 10 mum strength, indicating that the [Ne V] emission is not strongly orientation dependent. This suggests that the obscuring material (e.g., torus) is not very optically thick at 14 mum consistent with the results of Buchanan et al. We search for correlations between AGN and starburst tracers and we conclude that the AGN and starburst tracers are not correlated. This is consistent with our conclusion that the relative strength of the AGN and starburst components varies widely across the sample. Thus, there is no simple link between AGN fueling and black hole growth and star formation in these galaxies. The density diagnostic [Ne V] 14/24 mum and [S III] 18/33 mum line ratios are consistent with the gas being near the low density limit, i.e., ~103 cm-3 for [Ne V] and ne ~ few hundred cm-3 for [S III]. The distribution of silicate 10 mum and 18 mum strengths is consistent with the clumpy torus models of Sirocky et al. We find a rank correlation between the [Ne V] 14 mum line and the 6.7 mum continuum which may be due to an extended component of hot dust. The Sy 2's with a hidden broad-line region (HBLR) have a higher ratio of AGN-to-starburst contribution to the spectral energy distribution than Sy 2's without an HBLR. This may contribute to the detection of the HBLR in polarized light. The Sy 2's with an HBLR are more similar to the Sy 1's than they are to the Sy 2's without an HBLR.},

@article{Wu:2009pt,
  abstract = {We present low-resolution 5.5-35 mum spectra for 103 galaxies from the 12 mum Seyfert sample, a complete unbiased 12 mum flux limited sample of local Seyfert galaxies selected from the IRAS Faint Source Catalog, obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) on-board Spitzer Space Telescope. For 70 of the sources observed in the IRS mapping mode, uniformly extracted nuclear spectra are presented for the first time. We performed an analysis of the continuum emission, the strength of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) and astronomical silicate features of the sources. We find that on average, the 15-30 mum slope of the continuum is langalpha15-30rang = -0.85 $\pm$ 0.61 for Seyfert 1s and -1.53 $\pm$ 0.84 for Seyfert 2s, and there is substantial scatter in each type. Moreover, nearly 32% of the Seyfert 1s, and 9% of the Seyfert 2s, display a peak in the mid-infrared spectrum at 20 mum, which is attributed to an additional hot dust component. The PAH equivalent width decreases with increasing dust temperature, as indicated by the global infrared color of the host galaxies. However, no statistical difference in PAH equivalent width is detected between the two Seyfert types, 1 and 2, of the same bolometric luminosity. The silicate features at 9.7 and 18 mum in Seyfert 1 galaxies are rather weak, while Seyfert 2s are more likely to display strong silicate absorption. Those Seyfert 2s with the highest silicate absorption also have high infrared luminosity and high absorption (hydrogen column density NH > 1023 cm-2) as measured from the X-rays. Finally, we propose a new method to estimate the active galactic nucleus contribution to the integrated 12 mum galaxy emission, by subtracting the star formation component in the Seyfert galaxies, making use of the tight correlation between PAH 11.2 mum luminosity and 12 mum luminosity for star-forming galaxies.},

@article{Buchanan:2006cq,
  abstract = {We are conducting a large observing program with the Spitzer Space Telescope to determine the mid- to far-IR spectral energy distributions of a well-defined sample of 87 nearby, 12 mum-selected Seyfert galaxies. In this paper we present the results of Spitzer IRS low-resolution spectroscopy of a statistically representative subsample of 51 of the galaxies (59%), with an analysis of the continuum shapes and a comparison of the Seyfert types. We find that the spectra clearly divide into groups based on their continuum shapes and spectral features. The largest group (47% of the sample of 51) shows a very red continuum suggestive of cool dust and strong emission features attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Sixteen objects (31%) have a power-law continuum with spectral indices of alpha5-20 mum=-2.3 to -0.9 that flatten to alpha20-35 mum=-1.1 to 0.0 at ~20 mum. Clear silicate emission features at 10 and 18 mum are found in two of these objects (Mrk 6 and Mrk 335). A further 16% of the sample show power-law continua with unchanging slopes of alpha5-35 mum=-1.7 to -1.1. Two objects are dominated by a broad silicate absorption feature. One object in the sample shows an unusual spectrum dominated by emission features, which is unlike any of the other spectra. Some spectral features are clearly related to a starburst contribution to the IR spectrum, while the mechanisms producing observed power-law continuum shapes, attributed to an active galactic nucleus (AGN) component, may be dust or nonthermal emission. The IR spectral types appear to be related to the Seyfert types. Principal component analysis results suggest that the relative contribution of starburst emission may be the dominant cause of variance in the observed spectra. The derived starburst component of each spectrum, however, contributes <40% of the total flux density. We compare the IR emission with the optically thin radio emission associated with the AGN and find that Seyfert 1 galaxies have higher ratios of IR to radio emission than Seyfert 2 galaxies, as predicted by the unified model if the torus is optically thick in the mid-IR. However, smooth-density torus models predict a much larger difference between Seyfert types 1 and 2 than the factor of 2 difference observed in our sample; the observed factor of ~2 difference between the type 1 and type 2 galaxies in their IR-to-radio ratios above 15 mum requires the standard smooth-density torus models to be optically thin at these wavelengths. However, the resulting low torus opacity requires that the high observed columns detected in X-ray absorption be produced in gas with a very low dust-to-gas ratio (perhaps within the dust sublimation region). On the other hand, our observations may be consistent with clumpy torus models containing a steep radial distribution of optically thick dense clumps. The selection of our sample at 12 mum, where the torus may be optically thick, implies that there may be orientation-dependent biases in the sample; however, we do not find that the sample is biased toward Seyfert 2 galaxies with more luminous central engines, as would be expected. We find that the Seyfert 2 galaxies typically show stronger starburst contributions than the Seyfert 1 galaxies in the sample, contrary to what is expected based on the unified scheme for AGNs. This may be due to the selection effect that only those Seyfert 2 galaxies with strong starburst contributions had high enough integrated 12 mum flux densities to fall above the flux limit of the sample.},

@article{Noll:2009qq,
  abstract = {Aims: Photometric data of galaxies covering the rest-frame wavelength range from far-UV to far-IR make it possible to derive galaxy properties with a high reliability by fitting the attenuated stellar emission and the related dust emission at the same time. Methods: For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale & Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes were computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. Results: For up to 17 filters with effective wavelengths between 0.15 and 160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 {\AA}, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. Details of the star formation history (excepting the burst fraction) and the shape of the attenuation curve are difficult to investigate with the available broad-band UV and optical photometric data. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 1011 M&sun; towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest galaxies in the SINGS sample are present in the same mass range. On the other hand, the far-UV attenuation of our sample galaxies does not appear to show a significant dependence on star formation activity. Conclusions: The results for our SINGS test sample demonstrate that CIGALE can be a valuable tool for studying basic properties of galaxies in the near and distant Universe if UV-to-IR data are available.},

  abstract = {We combine Herschel Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer and Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver maps of the full 2 deg2 Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field with existing multi-wavelength data to obtain template and model-independent optical-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 4218 Herschel-selected sources with log(L IR/L &sun;) = 9.4-13.6 and z = 0.02-3.54. Median SEDs are created by binning the optical to far-infrared (FIR) bands available in COSMOS as a function of infrared luminosity. Herschel probes rest-frame wavelengths where the bulk of the infrared radiation is emitted, allowing us to more accurately determine fundamental dust properties of our sample of infrared luminous galaxies. We find that the SED peak wavelength (lambdapeak) decreases and the dust mass (M dust) increases with increasing total infrared luminosity (L IR). In the lowest infrared luminosity galaxies (log(L IR/L &sun;) = 10.0-11.5), we see evidence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features (lambda ~ 7-9 mum), while in the highest infrared luminosity galaxies (L IR > 1012 L &sun;) we see an increasing contribution of hot dust and/or power-law emission, consistent with the presence of heating from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We study the relationship between stellar mass and star formation rate of our sample of infrared luminous galaxies and find no evidence that Herschel-selected galaxies follow the SFR/M * main sequence as previously determined from studies of optically selected, star-forming galaxies. Finally, we compare the mid-infrared to FIR properties of our infrared luminous galaxies using the previously defined diagnostic, IR8 ≡ L IR/L 8, and find that galaxies with L IR >~ 1011.3 L &sun; tend to systematically lie above (× 3-5) the IR8 infrared main sequence, suggesting either suppressed PAH emission or an increasing contribution from AGN heating.},

@article{Casey:2012jl,
  abstract = {Spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting in the far-infrared (FIR) is greatly limited by a dearth of data and an excess of free parameters - from galaxies' dust composition, temperature, mass, orientation, opacity, to heating from active galactic nuclei (AGN). This paper presents a simple FIR SED fitting technique joining a modified, single dust temperature greybody, representing the reprocessed starburst emission in the whole galaxy, to a mid-infrared (MIR) power law, which approximates hot-dust emission from AGN heating or clumpy, hot starbursting regions. This FIR SED can be used to measure IR luminosities, dust temperatures and dust masses for both local and high-z galaxies with three to 10+ FIR photometric measurements. While the fitting technique does not model emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the MIR, the impact of PAH features on integrated FIR properties is negligible when compared to the bulk emission at longer wavelengths.  This fitting method is compared to IR template SEDs in the literature using photometric data on 65 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies, (U)LIRGs. Despite relying only on 2-4 free parameters, the coupled greybody/power-law SED fitting described here produces better fits to photometric measurements than best-fitting literature template SEDs (with residuals a factor of ˜2 lower). A mean emissivity index of beta = 1.60 $\pm$ 0.38 and MIR power-law slope of alpha = 2.0 $\pm$ 0.5 is measured; the former agrees with the widely presumed emissivity index of beta = 1.5 and the latter is indicative of an optically thin dust medium with a shallow radial density profile, ≈r-1/2. Adopting characteristic dust temperature as the inverse wavelength where the SED peaks, dust temperatures ˜25-45 K are measured for local (U)LIRGs, ˜5-15 K colder than previous estimates using only simple greybodies. This comparative study highlights the impact of SED fitting assumptions on the measurement of physical properties such as IR luminosity (and thereby IR-based star formation rate), dust temperature and dust mass, for both local and high-redshift galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present millimetre observations of a sample of 12 high-redshift ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) in the extended growth strip (EGS). These objects were initially selected on the basis of their observed mid-IR colours (0.0 < [3.6] - [4.5] < 0.4 and -0.7 < [3.6] - [8.0] < 0.5) to lie at high redshift 1.5 <~ z <~ 3, and subsequent 20-38 mum mid-IR spectroscopy confirms that they lie in a narrow redshift window centred on z ~ 2. We detect 9/12 of the objects in our sample at high significance (>3sigma) with a mean 1200 mum flux of <F1200mum> = 1.6 +/- 0.1 mJy. Our millimetre photometry, combined with existing far-IR photometry from the Far-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (FIDELS) and accurate spectroscopic redshifts, places constraints both sides of the thermal dust peak. This allows us to estimate the dust properties, including the far-IR luminosity, dust temperature and dust mass. We find that our sample is similar to other high-z and intermediate-z ULIRGs, and local systems, but has a different dust selection function than submillimeter-selected galaxies. Finally, we use existing 20-cm radio continuum imaging to test the far-IR/radio correlation at high redshift. We find that our sample is consistent with the local relation, implying little evolution. Furthermore, this suggests that our sample selection method is efficient at identifying ultraluminous, starburst-dominated systems within a very narrow redshift range centred at z ~ 2.},

  abstract = {Luminous (LIRGs; log (L IR/L &sun;) = 11.00-11.99) and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs; log (L IR/L &sun;) = 12.00-12.99) are the most extreme star-forming galaxies in the universe. The local (U)LIRGs provide a unique opportunity to study their multi-wavelength properties in detail for comparison with their more numerous counterparts at high redshifts. We present common large aperture photometry at radio through X-ray wavelengths and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for a sample of 53 nearby (z < 0.083) LIRGs and 11 ULIRGs spanning log (L IR/L &sun;) = 11.14-12.57 from the flux-limited (f 60 mum > 5.24 Jy) Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey. The SEDs for all objects are similar in that they show a broad, thermal stellar peak (~0.3-2 mum), and a dominant FIR (~40-200 mum) thermal dust peak, where nuL nu(60 mum)/nuL nu(V) increases from ~2 to 30 with increasing L IR. When normalized at IRAS 60 mum, the largest range in the luminosity ratio, R(lambda) ≡ log[nuL nu(lambda)/nuL nu(60 mum)], observed over the full sample is seen in the hard X-rays (HX = 2-10 keV), where DeltaR HX = 3.73 (\bar{R}_{HX} = -3.10). A small range is found in the radio (1.4 GHz), DeltaR 1.4 GHz = 1.75, where the mean ratio is largest, (\bar{R}_1.4\,GHz = -5.81). Total infrared luminosities, L IR(8-1000 mum), dust temperatures, and dust masses were computed from fitting thermal dust emission modified blackbodies to the mid-infrared (MIR) through submillimeter SEDs. The new results reflect an overall ~0.02 dex lower luminosity than the original IRAS values. Total stellar masses were computed by fitting stellar population synthesis models to the observed near-infrared (NIR) through ultraviolet (UV) SEDs. Mean stellar masses are found to be log (M sstarf/M &sun;) = 10.79 $\pm$ 0.40. Star formation rates have been determined from the infrared (SFRIR ~ 45 M &sun; yr-1) and from the monochromatic UV luminosities (SFRUV ~ 1.3 M &sun; yr-1), respectively. Multi-wavelength active galactic nucleus (AGN) indicators have be used to select putative AGNs: About 60% of the ULIRGs would have been classified as an AGN by at least one of the selection criteria.},

@article{Rosario:2013ee,
  abstract = {We explore the nature of the long-wavelength mid-infrared (MIR) emission of a sample of 13,000 local Type II (narrow-line) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) using 12 mum and 22 mum photometry from the WISE all-sky survey. In combination with FIRST 1.4 GHz photometry, we show that AGNs divide into two relatively distinct populations or branches in the plane of MIR and radio luminosity. Seyfert galaxies lie almost exclusively on an MIR-bright branch (Branch A), while low-ionization nuclear emission line galaxies (LINERs) are split evenly into Branch A and the MIR-faint Branch B. We devise various tests to constrain the processes that define the branches, including a comparison to the properties of pure star-forming inactive galaxies on the MIR-radio plane. We demonstrate that the total MIR emission of objects on Branch A, including most Seyfert galaxies, is governed primarily by host star formation, with ≈15% of the 22 mum luminosity coming from AGN-heated dust. This implies that ongoing dusty star formation is a general property of Seyfert host galaxies. We show that the 12 mum broadband luminosity of AGNs on Branch A is suppressed with respect to star-forming galaxies, possibly due to the destruction of PAHs or deeper 10 mum Si absorption in AGNs. We uncover a correlation between the MIR luminosity and [O III] lambda5007 luminosity in AGNs. This suggests a relationship between the star formation rate and nuclear luminosity in the AGN population, but we caution on the importance of selection effects inherent to such AGN-dominated emission-line galaxies in driving such a correlation. We highlight the MIR-radio plane as a useful tool in comparative studies of star formation and nuclear activity in AGNs.},

@article{Urry:1995il,
  abstract = {The appearance of active galactic nuclei (AGN) depends so strongly on orientation that our current classification schemes are dominated by random pointing directions instead of more interesting physical properties. Light from the centers of many AGN is obscrued by optically thick circumstellar matter, particularly at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths. In radio-loud AGN, bipolar jets emanating from the nucleus emit radio through gamma-ray light that is relativistically beamed along the jet axes. Understanding the origin and magnitude of radiation anistropies in AGN allows us to unify different classes of AGN; that is, to identify each single, underlying AGN type that gives rise to different classes through different orientations. This review describes the unification of radio-loud AGN, which includes radio galaxies, quasars, and blazars. We describe the classification and general properties of AGN. We summarize the evidence for anisotropic emission caused by circumstellar obscuration and relativistic beaming. We outline the two most plausible unified schemes for radio-loud AGN, one linking the high-luminosity sources (BL Lac objects and less luminous radio galaxies). Using the formalism appropriate to samples biased by relativistic beaming, we show the population statistics for two schemes are in accordance with available data. We analyze the possible connections between low- and high-luminosity radio-loud AGN and conclude they probably are powered by similar physical processes, at least within the relativistic jet. We review potential difficulties with unification and conclude that none currently constitutes a serious problem. We discuss likely complications to unified schemes that are suggested by realistic physical considerations; these will be important to consider when more comprehensive data for larger complete samples become available. We conclude with a list of the ten questions we believe are the most pressing in this field. (SECTION: Invited Review Paper)},

  abstract = {We study the optical colors of 147,920 galaxies brighter than g*=21, observed in five bands by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) over ~100 deg2 of high Galactic latitude sky along the celestial equator. The distribution of galaxies in the g*-r* versus u*-g* color-color diagram is strongly bimodal, with an optimal color separator of u*-r*=2.22. We use visual morphology and spectral classification of subsamples of 287 and 500 galaxies, respectively, to show that the two peaks correspond roughly to early- (E, S0, and Sa) and late-type (Sb, Sc, and Irr) galaxies, as expected from their different stellar populations. We also find that the colors of galaxies are correlated with their radial profiles, as measured by the concentration index and by the likelihoods of exponential and de Vaucouleurs' profile fits. While it is well known that late-type galaxies are bluer than early-type galaxies, this is the first detection of a local minimum in their color distribution. In all SDSS bands, the counts versus apparent magnitude relations for the two color types are significantly different and demonstrate that the fraction of blue galaxies increases toward the faint end.},

@article{Faber:2007jw,
  abstract = {The DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys are compared to study luminosity functions of red and blue galaxies to z~1. The two surveys have different methods and sensitivities, but nevertheless results agree. After z~1, M*B has dimmed by 1.2-1.3 mag for all colors of galaxies, phi* for blue galaxies has hardly changed, and phi* for red galaxies has at least doubled (our formal value is ~0.5 dex). Luminosity density jB has fallen by 0.6 dex for blue galaxies but has remained nearly constant for red galaxies. These results imply that the number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies have been substantially constant since z~1, whereas those of red galaxies (near L*) have been significantly rising. To explain the new red galaxies, a ``mixed'' scenario is proposed in which star formation in blue cloud galaxies is quenched, causing them to migrate to the red sequence, where they merge further in a small number of stellar mergers. This mixed scenario matches the local boxy-disky transition for nearby ellipticals, as well as red sequence stellar population scaling laws such as the color-magnitude and Mg-sigma relations (which are explained as fossil relics from blue progenitors). Blue galaxies enter the red sequence via different quenching modes, each of which peaks at a different characteristic mass and time. The red sequence therefore likely builds up in different ways at different times and masses, and the concept of a single process that is ``downsizing'' (or upsizing) probably does not apply. Our claim in this paper of a rise in the number of red galaxies applies to galaxies near L*. Accurate counts of brighter galaxies on the steep part of the Schechter function require more accurate photometry than is currently available.  Based on observations taken at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated jointly by the University of California and the California Institute of Technology, and on observations made with the NASA/ESO Hubble Space Telescope, obtained from the data archives at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555, and from the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre.},

  abstract = {We use multi-band spatially resolved photometry from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Legacy Survey in the 4 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South to explore the nuclear and extended colors, color gradients, and stellar populations of the host galaxies of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) out to z = 3. Based on a study of their central light, we develop X-ray based criteria to exclude objects with strong AGN contamination. We use stellar masses from the FIREWORKS database to understand and account for stellar mass selection effects and carefully study, for the first time, the resolved host galaxy properties of AGNs at z ~ 2 in their rest-frame optical light without substantial nuclear contamination. AGN hosts span a sizable range of stellar masses, colors, and color gradients at these redshifts. Their colors, color gradients, and stellar population properties are very similar to inactive galaxies of the same stellar mass. At z ~ 1, we find a slightly narrower range in host colors compared to inactive galaxies, as well as hints of more recent star formation. These differences are weaker or non-existent among AGN hosts at z ~ 2. We discuss the importance of AGN-driven feedback in the quenching of galaxies at z >~ 1 and speculate on possible evolution in the relationship between black hole accretion and the host galaxy toward high redshifts.},

@article{Rosario:2013ye,
  abstract = {We explore the question of whether low and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are preferentially found in galaxies that are undergoing a transition from active star formation (SF) to quiescence. This notion has been suggested by studies of the UV-optical colors of AGN hosts, which find them to be common among galaxies in the so-called Green Valley, a region of galaxy color space believed to be composed mostly of galaxies undergoing SF quenching. Combining the deepest current X-ray and Herschel/PACS far-infrared (FIR) observations of the two Chandra Deep Fields with redshifts, stellar masses, and rest-frame photometry derived from the extensive and uniform multi-wavelength data in these fields, we compare the rest-frame U - V color distributions and star formation rate distributions of AGNs and carefully constructed samples of inactive control galaxies. The UV-to-optical colors of AGNs are consistent with equally massive inactive galaxies at redshifts out to z ~ 2, but we show that such colors are poor tracers of SF. While the FIR distributions of both star-forming AGNs and star-forming inactive galaxies are statistically similar, we show that AGNs are preferentially found in star-forming host galaxies, or, in other words, AGNs are less likely to be found in weakly star-forming or quenched galaxies. We postulate that, among X-ray-selected AGNs of low and moderate accretion luminosities, the supply of cold gas primarily determines the accretion rate distribution of the nuclear black holes.},

@article{Kauffmann:2009bv,
  abstract = {We analyse the observed distribution of Eddington ratios (L/LEdd) as a function of supermassive black hole mass for a large sample of nearby galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We demonstrate that there are two distinct regimes of black hole growth in nearby galaxies. The first is associated with galaxies with significant star formation [M*/starformationrate (SFR) ~ a Hubble time] in their central kiloparsec regions, and is characterized by a broad lognormal distribution of accretion rates peaked at a few per cent of the Eddington limit. In this regime, the Eddington ratio distribution is independent of the mass of the black hole and shows little dependence on the central stellar population of the galaxy. The second regime is associated with galaxies with old central stellar populations (M*/SFR >> a Hubble time), and is characterized by a power-law distribution function of Eddington ratios. In this regime, the time-averaged mass accretion rate on to black holes is proportional to the mass of stars in the galaxy bulge, with a constant of proportionality that depends on the mean stellar age of the stars. This result is once again independent of black hole mass. We show that both the slope of the power law and the decrease in the accretion rate on to black holes in old galaxies are consistent with population synthesis model predictions of the decline in stellar mass loss rates as a function of mean stellar age. Our results lead to a very simple picture of black hole growth in the local Universe. If the supply of cold gas in a galaxy bulge is plentiful, the black hole regulates its own growth at a rate that does not further depend on the properties of the interstellar medium. Once the gas runs out, black hole growth is regulated by the rate at which evolved stars lose their mass.},

  abstract = {We analyze the dependence of galaxy structure (size and S{\'e}rsic index) and mode of star formation (SigmaSFR and SFRIR/SFRUV) on the position of galaxies in the star formation rate (SFR) versus mass diagram. Our sample comprises roughly 640,000 galaxies at z ~ 0.1, 130,000 galaxies at z ~ 1, and 36,000 galaxies at z ~ 2. Structural measurements for all but the z ~ 0.1 galaxies are based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging, and SFRs are derived using a Herschel-calibrated ladder of SFR indicators. We find that a correlation between the structure and stellar population of galaxies (i.e., a Hubble sequence) is already in place since at least z ~ 2.5. At all epochs, typical star-forming galaxies on the main sequence are well approximated by exponential disks, while the profiles of quiescent galaxies are better described by de Vaucouleurs profiles. In the upper envelope of the main sequence, the relation between the SFR and S{\'e}rsic index reverses, suggesting a rapid buildup of the central mass concentration in these starbursting outliers. We observe quiescent, moderately and highly star-forming systems to co-exist over an order of magnitude or more in stellar mass. At each mass and redshift, galaxies on the main sequence have the largest size. The rate of size growth correlates with specific SFR, and so does SigmaSFR at each redshift. A simple model using an empirically determined star formation law and metallicity scaling, in combination with an assumed geometry for dust and stars, is able to relate the observed SigmaSFR and SFRIR/SFRUV, provided a more patchy dust geometry is assumed for high-redshift galaxies.},

@article{Dutton:2010fe,
  abstract = {We use a semi-analytic model for disk galaxies to explore the origin of the time evolution and small scatter of the galaxy SFR sequence - the tight correlation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (Mstar). The steep decline of SFR from z ~ 2 to the present, at fixed Mstar, is a consequence of the following. First, disk galaxies are in a steady state with the SFR following the net (i.e. inflow minus outflow) gas accretion rate. The evolution of the SFR sequence is determined by evolution in the cosmological specific accretion rates, ~ (1 + z)2.25, but is found to be independent of feedback. Although feedback determines the outflow rates, it shifts galaxies along the SFR sequence, leaving its zero-point invariant. Second, the conversion of accretion rate to SFR is materialized through gas density, not gas mass. Although the model SFR is an increasing function of both gas mass fraction and gas density, only the gas densities are predicted to evolve significantly with redshift. Third, star formation is fueled by molecular gas. Since the molecular gas fraction increases monotonically with increasing gas density, the model predicts strong evolution in the molecular gas fractions, increasing by an order of magnitude from z = 0 to z ~ 2. On the other hand, the model predicts that the effective surface density of atomic gas is , independent of redshift, stellar mass or feedback. Our model suggests that the scatter in the SFR sequence reflects variations in the gas accretion history, and thus is insensitive to stellar mass, redshift or feedback. The large scatter in halo spin contributes negligibly, because it scatters galaxies along the SFR sequence. An observational consequence of this is that the scatter in the SFR sequence is independent of the size (both stellar and gaseous) of galaxy disks.},

@article{Rodighiero:2010ef,
  abstract = {Aims: We exploit deep observations of the GOODS-N field taken with PACS, the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer, onboard of Herschel, as part of the PACS evolutionary probe guaranteed time (PEP), to study the link between star formation and stellar mass in galaxies to z ~ 2.  Methods: Starting from a stellar mass - selected sample of ~4500 galaxies with mag4.5 µm < 23.0 (AB), we identify ~350 objects with a PACS detection at 100 or 160 mum and ~1500 with only Spitzer 24 mum counterpart. Stellar masses and total IR luminosities (LIR) are estimated by fitting the spectral energy distributions (SEDs).  Results: Consistently with other Herschel results, we find that LIR based only on 24 mum data is overestimated by a median factor ~1.8 at z ~ 2, whereas it is underestimated (with our approach) up to a factor ~1.6 at 0.5 < z < 1.0. We then exploit this calibration to correct LIR based on the MIPS/Spitzer fluxes. These results clearly show how Herschel is fundamental to constrain LIR, and hence the star formation rate (SFR), of high redshift galaxies. Using the galaxies detected with PACS (and/or MIPS), we investigate the existence and evolution of the relations between the SFR, the specific star formation rate (SSFR=SFR/mass) and the stellar mass. Moreover, in order to avoid selection effects, we also repeat this study through a stacking analysis on the PACS images to fully exploit the far-IR information also for the Herschel and Spitzer undetected subsamples. We find that the SSFR-mass relation steepens with redshift, being almost flat at z < 1.0 and reaching a slope of alpha = -0.50+0.13-0.16 at z ~ 2, at odds with recent works based on radio-stacking analysis at the same redshift. The mean SSFR of galaxies increases with redshift, by a factor ~15 for massive M > 1011 M&sun; galaxies from z = 0 to z = 2, and seems to flatten at z > 1.5 in this mass range. Moreover, the most massive galaxies have the lowest SSFR at any z, implying that they have formed their stars earlier and more rapidly than their low mass counterparts (downsizing).

@article{Daddi:2007if,
  abstract = {Examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4<z<2.5 with KVega<22 from GOODS, we compare photometry from Spitzer at mid- and far-IR to submillimeter, radio, and rest-frame UV wavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formation rates (SFRs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. For z~2 galaxies with moderate luminosities (L8mum<1011 Lsolar), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However, 20%-30% of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L8mum>1011 Lsolar, show a mid-IR excess that is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24 mum-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of ~4 and ~30 relative to that in star-forming galaxies at z=1 and 0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively ``transparent'' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived (>~400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity. Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4 and the space density of ULIRGs by an order of magnitude but give better agreement for z>1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

@article{Lara-Lopez:2013rp,
  abstract = {A full appreciation of the role played by gas metallicity (Z), star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M*) is fundamental to understanding how galaxies form and evolve. The connections between these three parameters at different redshifts significantly affect galaxy evolution, and thus provide important constraints for galaxy evolution models. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey-Data Release 7 (SDSS-DR7) and the Galaxy and Mass Assembly (GAMA) surveys, we study the relationships and dependences between SFR, Z and M*, as well as the Fundamental Plane for star-forming galaxies. We combine both surveys using volume-limited samples up to a redshift of z ≈ 0.36. The GAMA and SDSS surveys complement each other when analysing the relationships between SFR, M* and Z. We present evidence for SFR and metallicity evolution to z ˜ 0.2. We study the dependences between SFR, M*, Z and specific SFR (SSFR) on the M*-Z, M*-SFR, M*-SSFR, Z-SFR and Z-SSFR relations, finding strong correlations between all. Based on those dependences, we propose a simple model that allows us to explain the different behaviour observed between low- and high-mass galaxies. Finally, our analysis allows us to confirm the existence of a Fundamental Plane, for which M* = f(Z, SFR) in star-forming galaxies.},

@article{Elbaz:2007ud,
  abstract = {Aims:We study the relationship between the local environment of galaxies and their star formation rate (SFR) in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, GOODS, at z˜1.   Methods: We use ultradeep imaging at 24 mum with the MIPS camera onboard {Spitzer} to determine the contribution of obscured light to the SFR of galaxies over the redshift range 0.8<= z <=1.2. Accurate galaxy densities are measured thanks to the large sample of  1200 spectroscopic redshifts with high ( 70%) spectroscopic completeness. Morphology and stellar masses are derived from deep HST-ACS imaging, supplemented by ground based imaging programs and photometry from the IRAC camera onboard {Spitzer}.   Results: We show that the star formation-density relation observed locally was reversed at z˜ 1: the average SFR of an individual galaxy increased with local galaxy density when the universe was less than half its present age. Hierarchical galaxy formation models (simulated lightcones from the Millennium model) predicted such a reversal to occur only at earlier epochs (z>2) and at a lower level. We present a remarkable structure at z˜ 1.016, containing X-ray traced galaxy concentrations, which will eventually merge into a Virgo-like cluster. This structure illustrates how the individual SFR of galaxies increases with density and shows that it is the  1-2 Mpc scale that affects most the star formation in galaxies at z˜1. The SFR of z˜1 galaxies is found to correlate with stellar mass suggesting that mass plays a role in the observed star formation-density trend. However the specific SFR (=SFR/Mstar) decreases with stellar mass while it increases with galaxy density, which implies that the environment does directly affect the star formation activity of galaxies. Major mergers do not appear to be the unique or even major cause for this effect since nearly half (46%) of the luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) at z˜ 1 present the HST-ACS morphology of spirals, while only a third present a clear signature of major mergers. The remaining galaxies are divided into compact (9%) and irregular (14%) galaxies. Moreover, the specific SFR of major mergers is only marginally stronger than that of spirals.   Conclusions: These findings constrain the influence of the growth of large-scale structures on the star formation history of galaxies. Reproducing the SFR-density relation at z˜1 is a new challenge for models, requiring a correct balance between mass assembly through mergers and in-situ star formation at early epochs.},

@article{Brinchmann:2004bf,
  abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the physical properties of ~ 105 galaxies with measurable star formation in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By comparing physical information extracted from the emission lines with continuum properties, we build up a picture of the nature of star-forming galaxies at z < 0.2. We develop a method for aperture correction using resolved imaging and show that our method takes out essentially all aperture bias in the star formation rate (SFR) estimates, allowing an accurate estimate of the total SFRs in galaxies. We determine the SFR density to be 1.915+0.02-0.01 (random)+0.14-0.42 (systematic) h7010-2 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 at z= 0.1 (for a Kroupa initial mass function) and we study the distribution of star formation as a function of various physical parameters. The majority of the star formation in the low-redshift Universe takes place in moderately massive galaxies (1010-1011 Msolar), typically in high surface brightness disc galaxies. Roughly 15 per cent of all star formation takes place in galaxies that show some sign of an active nucleus. About 20 per cent occurs in starburst galaxies. By focusing on the SFR per unit mass we show that the present to past average SFR, the Scalo b-parameter, is almost constant over almost three orders of magnitude in mass, declining only at M* > 1010 Msolar. The volume averaged b parameter is 0.408+0.005-0.002 (random)+0.029-0.090 (systematic)h-170. We use this value to constrain the star formation history of the Universe. For the concordance cosmology the present-day Universe is forming stars at at least 1/3 of its past average rate. For an exponentially declining cosmic star formation history this corresponds to a time-scale of 7+0.7-1.5 Gyr. In agreement with other work we find a correlation between b and morphological type, as well as a tight correlation between the 4000-{\AA}break (D4000) and b. We discuss how D4000 can be used to estimate b parameters for high-redshift galaxies.},

Selection of AGN from ultra-hard X-rays avoids bias from obscuration that are unavoidable at other wavelengths (eg optical, infrared, and radio) providing the most complete sample of AGN to study the connection between nuclear activity and star formation in host galaxies. With the high angular resolution of PACS, we find that ~35% and ~20% of the sources are 'point-like' at 70 and 160 mum respectively with another 20% that have their flux dominated by a point source located at the nucleus. The inferred star formation rates (SFR) of 0.1 - 100 Msun yr-1 using the 70 and 160 mum flux densities and the calibration of Calzettti et al (2010) are consistent with those inferred from Spitzer NeII fluxes, but we find that 11.25 mum PAH data give ~3x lower SFR. Using GALFIT to measure the size of the FIR emitting regions, we determined the SFR density [Msun yr-1 kpc-2] for our sample, finding a significant fraction to exist above the threshold for star formation driven winds (0.1 Msun yr-1 kpc-2, Heckman 2001). Analysis of the SPIRE colors (250/350 and 350/500) also reveals evidence for the presence of nonthermal synchrotron emission from a radio jet significantly affecting the FIR emission at long wavelengths and altering the shape of the spectral energy distribution (SED). We also will present the broad band Herschel 70-500m SEDS for our sample and include archival Spitzer, WISE, FIRST and NVSS data to extend the SED down to near-IR and up to radio wavelengths. The SEDs will be fit using multiple models to attempt to determine the AGN contribution to the FIR (indirect or direct) and ultimately its effect on nuclear star formation.},

The galaxies are divided into 4 spectral and 4 morphological types. For the star forming and unclassifiable galaxies we calculate dust extinctions from the UV slope, the H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratio and the $L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm UV}$ ratio. There is a tight correlation between the dust extinction and both $L_{\rm IR}$ and metallicity. We calculate SFR$_{total}$ and compare it with other SFR estimates (H$\alpha$, UV, SDSS) finding a very good agreement between them with smaller dispersions than typical SFR uncertainties. We study the effect of mass and metallicity, finding that it is only significant at high masses for SFR$_{H\alpha}$. For the AGN and composite galaxies we find a tight correlation between SFR and L$_{IR}$ ($\sigma\sim$0.29), while the dispersion in the SFR - L$_{UV}$ relation is larger ($\sigma\sim$0.57). The galaxies follow the prescriptions of the Fundamental Plane in the M-Z-SFR space.},

@article{Del-Moro:2013yf,
  abstract = {Context. A tight correlation exists between far-infrared and radio emission for star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which seems to hold out to high redshifts (z ≈ 2). Any excess of radio emission over that expected from star formation processes is most likely produced by an active galactic nucleus (AGN), often hidden by large amounts of dust and gas. Identifying these radio-excess sources will allow us to study a population of AGN unbiased by obscuration and thus find some of the most obscured, Compton-thick AGN, which are in large part unidentified even in the deepest X-ray and infrared (IR) surveys.  Aims: We present here a new spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting approach that we adopt to select radio-excess sources amongst distant star-forming galaxies in the GOODS-Herschel (North) field and to reveal the presence of hidden, highly obscured AGN.  Methods: Through extensive SED analysis of 458 galaxies with radio 1.4 GHz and mid-IR 24 mum detections using some of the deepest Chandra X-ray, Spitzer and Herschel infrared, and VLA radio data available to date, we have robustly identified a sample of 51 radio-excess AGN (~1300 deg-2) out to redshift z ≈ 3. These radio-excess AGN have a significantly lower far-IR/radio ratio (q < 1.68, 3sigma) than the typical relation observed for star-forming galaxies (q ≈ 2.2).  Results: We find that ≈45% of these radio-excess sources have a dominant AGN component in the mid-IR band, while for the remainders the excess radio emission is the only indicator of AGN activity. The presence of an AGN is also confirmed by the detection of a compact radio core in deep VLBI 1.4 GHz observations for eight of our radio-excess sources (≈16%; ≈66% of the VLBI detected sources in this field), with the excess radio flux measured from our SED analysis agreeing, to within a factor of two, with the radio core emission measured by VLBI. We find that the fraction of radio-excess AGN increases with X-ray luminosity reaching ~60% at LX ≈ 1044 - 1045 erg s-1, making these sources an important part of the total AGN population. However, almost half (24/51) of these radio-excess AGN are not detected in the deep Chandra X-ray data, suggesting that some of these sources might be heavily obscured. Amongst the radio-excess AGN we can distinguish three groups of objects: i) AGN clearly identified in infrared (and often in X-rays), a fraction of which are likely to be distant Compton-thick AGN; ii) moderate luminosity AGN (LX ≲ 1043 erg s-1) hosted in strong star-forming galaxies; and iii) a small fraction of low accretion-rate AGN hosted in passive (i.e. weak or no star-forming) galaxies. We also find that the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) of the radio-excess AGN are on average lower that those observed for X-ray selected AGN hosts, indicating that our sources are forming stars more slowly than typical AGN hosts, and possibly their star formation is progressively quenching.

  abstract = {We present integral field unit (IFU) observations covering the [O III]4959,5007 and H-Beta emission lines of sixteen z<0.2 type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our targets are selected from a well-constrained parent sample of 24,000 AGN so that we can place our observations into the context of the overall AGN population. Our targets are radio-quiet with star formation rates (<~[10-100] Msol/yr) that are consistent with normal star-forming galaxies. We decouple the kinematics of galaxy dynamics and mergers from outflows. We find high-velocity ionised gas (velocity widths of 600-1500 km/s and maximum velocities of <=1700 km/s) with observed spatial extents of >~(6-16) kpc in all targets and observe signatures of spherical outflows and bi-polar superbubbles. We show that our targets are representative of z<0.2, luminous (i.e., L([O III]) > 5x10^41 erg/s) type 2 AGN and that ionised outflows are not only common but also in >=70% (3 sigma confidence) of cases, they are extended over kiloparsec scales. Our study demonstrates that galaxy-wide energetic outflows are not confined to the most extreme star-forming galaxies or radio-luminous AGN; however, there may be a higher incidence of the most extreme outflow velocities in quasars hosted in ultra-luminous infrared galaxies. Both star formation and AGN activity appear to be energetically viable to drive the outflows and we find no definitive evidence that favours one process over the other. Although highly uncertain, we derive mass outflow rates (typically ~10x the SFRs), kinetic energies (~0.5-10% of L[AGN]) and momentum rates (typically >~10-20x L[AGN]/c) consistent with theoretical models that predict AGN-driven outflows play a significant role in shaping the evolution of galaxies.},

  abstract = {Using Spitzer-infrared spectrograph (IRS) spectroscopy, we investigate the ubiquity of active galactic nuclei (AGN) in a complete (~94 per cent), volume-limited sample of the most bolometrically luminous galaxies [LIR,8-1000mum >~ (0.3-20) × 1010Lsolar] to D < 15 Mpc. Our analyses are based on the detection of the high-excitation emission line [NeV]lambda14.32mum (97.1 eV) to unambiguously identify AGN activity. We find that 17 of the 64 infrared (IR) bright galaxies in our sample host AGN activity (~27+8-6 per cent), >~50 per cent of which are not identified as AGN using optical spectroscopy. The large AGN fraction indicates a tighter connection between AGN activity and IR luminosity for galaxies in the local Universe than previously found, potentially indicating a close association between AGN activity and star formation. The optically unidentified AGN span a wide range of galaxy type (S0-Ir) and are typically starburst-dominated systems hosting modest-luminosity AGN activity (L[NeV] ~ 1037-1039ergs-1). The non-identification of optical AGN signatures in the majority of these galaxies appears to be due to extinction towards the AGN, rather than intrinsically low-luminosity AGN activity; however, we note that the AGN optical signatures are diluted in some galaxies due to strong star formation activity. Examination of optical images shows that the optically unidentified AGN with evidence for extinction are hosted in either highly inclined galaxies or galaxies with dust lanes, indicating that obscuration of the AGN is not necessarily due to an obscuring torus. We therefore conclude that optical spectroscopic surveys miss approximately half of the AGN population simply due to extinction through the host galaxy.},

  abstract = {We investigate the far-infrared (FIR) properties of X-ray sources detected in the Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S) survey using the ultradeep 70 and 24 mum Spitzer observations taken in this field. Since only 30 (i.e. ~10 per cent) of the 266 X-ray sources in the region of the 70 mum observations are detected at 70 mum, we rely on stacking analyses of the 70 mum data to characterize the average 70 mum properties of the X-ray sources as a function of redshift, X-ray luminosity and X-ray absorption. Using Spitzer-IRS data of the Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) sample of z ~ 0 active galactic nuclei (AGNs), we show that the 70/24 mum flux ratio can distinguish between AGN-dominated and starburst-dominated systems out to z ~ 1.5. Among the X-ray sources detected at 70 mum, we note a large scatter in the observed 70/24 mum flux ratios, spanning almost a factor of 10 at similar redshifts, irrespective of object classification, suggesting a range of AGN:starburst ratios. From stacking analyses we find that the average observed 70/24 mum flux ratios of AGNs out to an average redshift of 1.5 are similar to z ~ 0 AGNs with similar X-ray luminosities (LX = 1042-44ergs-1) and absorbing column densities (NH <= 1023cm-2). Furthermore, both high-redshift and z ~ 0 AGNs follow the same tendency towards warmer 70/24 mum colours with increasing X-ray luminosity (LX). From analyses of the Swift-BAT sample of z ~ 0 AGNs, we note that the 70 mum flux can be used to determine the IR (8-1000 mum) luminosities of high-redshift AGNs. We use this information to show that LX = 1042-43ergs-1 AGNs at high redshifts (z = 1-2) have IR to X-ray luminosity ratios (LIR/LX) that are, on average, 4.7+10.2-2.0 and 12.7+7.1-2.6 times higher than AGNs with similar X-ray luminosities at z = 0.5-1 and ~0, respectively. By comparison, we find that the LIR/LX ratios of LX = 1043-44ergs-1 AGNs remain largely unchanged across this same redshift interval. We explore the consequences that these results may have on the identification of distant, potentially Compton-thick AGNs using LIR/LX ratios. In addition, we discuss possible scenarios for the observed increase in the LIR/LX ratio with redshift, including changes in the dust covering factor of AGNs and/or the star formation rates of their host galaxies. Finally, we show how deep observations to be undertaken by the Herschel Space Observatory will enable us to discriminate between these proposed scenarios and also identify Compton-thick AGNs at high redshifts.},

@article{Burlon:2011pi,
  abstract = {It is well accepted that unabsorbed as well as absorbed active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are needed to explain the nature and shape of the Cosmic X-ray background (CXB), even if the fraction of highly absorbed objects (dubbed Compton-thick sources) still substantially escapes detection. We derive and analyze the absorption distribution using a complete sample of AGNs detected by Swift-BAT in the first three years of the survey. The fraction of Compton-thick AGNs represents only 4.6% of the total AGN population detected by Swift-BAT. However, we show that once corrected for the bias against the detection of very absorbed sources the real intrinsic fraction of Compton-thick AGNs is 20+9 -6%. We proved for the first time (also in the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) band) that the anti-correlation of the fraction of absorbed AGNs and luminosity is tightly connected to the different behavior of the X-ray luminosity functions (XLFs) of absorbed and unabsorbed AGNs. This points toward a difference between the two subsamples of objects with absorbed AGNs being, on average, intrinsically less luminous than unobscured ones. Moreover, the XLFs show that the fraction of obscured AGNs might also decrease at very low luminosity. This can be successfully interpreted in the framework of a disk cloud outflow scenario as the disappearance of the obscuring region below a critical luminosity. Our results are discussed in the framework of population synthesis models and the origin of the CXB.

  abstract = {The old, red stars that constitute the bulges of galaxies, and the massive black holes at their centres, are the relics of a period in cosmic history when galaxies formed stars at remarkable rates and active galactic nuclei (AGN) shone brightly as a result of accretion onto black holes. It is widely suspected, but unproved, that the tight correlation between the mass of the black hole and the mass of the stellar bulge results from the AGN quenching the surrounding star formation as it approaches its peak luminosity. X-rays trace emission from AGN unambiguously, whereas powerful star-forming galaxies are usually dust-obscured and are brightest at infrared and submillimetre wavelengths. Here we report submillimetre and X-ray observations that show that rapid star formation was common in the host galaxies of AGN when the Universe was 2-6 billion years old, but that the most vigorous star formation is not observed around black holes above an X-ray luminosity of 1044 ergs per second. This suppression of star formation in the host galaxy of a powerful AGN is a key prediction of models in which the AGN drives an outflow, expelling the interstellar medium of its host and transforming the galaxy's properties in a brief period of cosmic time.},

@article{Lutz:2008ph,
  abstract = {We present Spitzer rest frame mid-infrared spectroscopy of 12 z~2 millimeter-bright type 1 QSOs, selected from unlensed and lensed QSO samples and covering a range of AGN optical luminosities L5100=1045-1047 erg s-1. On top of the AGN continuum, we detect PAH emission from luminous star formation in nine objects individually, as well as in the composite spectrum for the full sample. PAH luminosity and rest frame far-infrared luminosity correlate and extend a similar correlation for lower luminosity local QSOs. This provides strong evidence for intense star formation in the hosts of these millimeter-bright QSOs, sometimes exceeding 1000 Msolar yr-1 and dominating their rest frame far-infrared emission. The PAH-based limit on star formation rates is lower for luminous z~2 QSOs that are not preselected for their millimeter emission. Partly dependent on systematic changes of the AGN dust covering factor and the dust spectral energy distribution of the AGN proper, the spectral energy distributions of millimeter-faint high-z QSOs may be AGN dominated out to rest frame far-infrared wavelengths. Toward the most luminous high-z QSOs, there is a flattening of the relation between star formation and AGN luminosity that is observed for lower redshift QSOs. No QSO in our sample has a PAH-measured star formation rate in excess of 3000 Msolar yr-1.},

@article{Birzan:2004la,
  abstract = {We present an analysis of 16 galaxy clusters, one group, and one galaxy drawn from the Chandra Data Archive. These systems possess prominent X-ray surface brightness depressions associated with cavities or bubbles that were created by interactions between powerful radio sources and the surrounding hot gas. The central galaxies in these systems harbor radio sources with luminosities ranging between ~2×1038 and 7×1044 ergs s-1. The cavities have an average radius of ~10 kpc, and they lie at an average projected distance of ~20 kpc from the central galaxy. The minimum energy associated with the cavities ranges from pV~1055 ergs in galaxies, groups, and poor clusters to pV~1060 ergs in rich clusters. We evaluate the hypothesis that cooling in the hot gas can be quenched by energy injected into the surrounding gas by the rising bubbles. We find that the instantaneous mechanical luminosities required to offset cooling range between 1pV and 20pV per cavity. Nearly half of the systems in this study may have instantaneous mechanical luminosities large enough to balance cooling, at least for a short period of time, if the cavities are filled with a relativistic gas. We find a trend or upper envelope in the distribution of central X-ray luminosity versus instantaneous mechanical luminosity, with the sense that the most powerful cavities are found in the most X-ray-luminous systems. Such a trend would be expected if many of these systems produce bubbles at a rate that scales in proportion to the cooling rate of the surrounding gas. Finally, we use the X-ray cavities to measure the mechanical power of radio sources over six decades of radio luminosity, independently of the radio properties themselves. We find that the ratio of the instantaneous mechanical (kinetic) luminosity to the 1.4 GHz synchrotron luminosity ranges typically between a few and roughly a few thousand for luminous radio sources but can be several thousand for weaker sources. This wide range implies that the 1.4 GHz synchrotron luminosity is an unreliable gauge of the mechanical power of radio sources.},

  abstract = {We present preliminary results from a deep observation lasting almost 200 ks of the centre of the Perseus cluster of galaxies around NGC 1275. The X-ray surface brightness of the intracluster gas beyond the inner 20 kpc, which contains the inner radio bubbles, is very smooth apart from some low-amplitude quasi-periodic ripples. A clear density jump at a radius of 24 kpc to the north-east, about 10 kpc out from the bubble rim, appears to be due to a weak shock driven by the northern radio bubble. A similar front may exist around both inner bubbles but is masked elsewhere by rim emission from bright cooler gas. The continuous blowing of bubbles by the central radio source, leading to the propagation of weak shocks and viscously dissipating sound waves seen as the observed fronts and ripples, gives a rate of working which balances the radiative cooling within the inner 50 kpc of the cluster core.},

@article{Veilleux:2013qq,
  abstract = {We report the results from a systematic search for molecular (OH 119 mum) outflows with Herschel/PACS in a sample of 43 nearby (z < 0.3) galaxy mergers, mostly ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and QSOs. We find that the character of the OH feature (strength of the absorption relative to the emission) correlates with that of the 9.7 mum silicate feature, a measure of obscuration in ULIRGs. Unambiguous evidence for molecular outflows, based on the detection of OH absorption profiles with median velocities more blueshifted than -50 km s-1, is seen in 26 (70%) of the 37 OH-detected targets, suggesting a wide-angle (~145$\,^{\circ}$) outflow geometry. Conversely, unambiguous evidence for molecular inflows, based on the detection of OH absorption profiles with median velocities more redshifted than +50 km s-1, is seen in only four objects, suggesting a planar or filamentary geometry for the inflowing gas. Terminal outflow velocities of ~-1000 km s-1 are measured in several objects, but median outflow velocities are typically ~-200 km s-1. While the outflow velocities show no statistically significant dependence on the star formation rate, they are distinctly more blueshifted among systems with large active galactic nucleus (AGN) fractions and luminosities [log (L AGN/L &sun;) >= 11.8 $\pm$ 0.3]. The quasars in these systems play a dominant role in driving the molecular outflows. However, the most AGN dominated systems, where OH is seen purely in emission, show relatively modest OH line widths, despite their large AGN luminosities, perhaps indicating that molecular outflows subside once the quasar has cleared a path through the obscuring material.},

@article{Mullaney:2013wd,
  abstract = {Using a sample of 24 264 optically selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the SDSS DR7 data base, we characterize how the profile of the [O III] lambda5007 emission line relates to bolometric luminosity (LAGN), Eddington ratio, radio loudness, radio luminosity (L1.4 GHz) and optical class (i.e. broad/narrow-line Seyfert 1, type 2) to determine what drives the kinematics of this kpc-scale line emitting gas. First, we use spectral stacking to characterize how the average [O III] lambda5007 profile changes as a function of these five variables. After accounting for the known correlation between LAGN and L1.4 GHz, we report that L1.4 GHz has the strongest influence on the [O III] lambda5007 profile, with AGNs of moderate radio luminosity (L1.4 GHz = 1023-1025 W Hz-1) having the broadest [O III] lambda5007 profiles. Conversely, we find only a modest change in the [O III] lambda5007 profile with increasing radio loudness and find no significant difference between the [O III] lambda5007 profiles of broad- and narrow-line Seyfert 1s. When binned according to Eddington ratio, only the AGNs in our highest bin (i.e. >0.3) show any signs of having broadened [O III] lambda5007 profiles, although the small numbers of such extreme AGNs in our sample mean we cannot rule out that other processes (e.g. radio jets) are responsible for this broadening. The [O III] lambda5007 profiles of type 1 and type 2 AGNs show the same trends in terms of line width, but type 1 AGNs display a much stronger `blue wing', which we interpret as evidence of outflowing ionized gas. We perform multicomponent fitting to the Hbeta, [O III] lambdalambda4959, 5007, [N II] lambdalambda6548, 6584 and Halpha lines for all the AGNs in our sample to calculate the proportions of AGNs with broad [O III] lambda5007 profiles. The individual fits confirm the results from our stacked spectra; AGNs with L1.4 GHz > 1023 W Hz-1 are roughly five times more likely to have extremely broad [O III] lambda5007 lines (full width at half-maximum, FWHMAvg > 1000 km s-1) compared to lower L1.4 GHz AGNs, and the width of the [O III] lambda5007 line peaks in moderate-radio-luminosity AGNs (L1.4 GHz ˜ 1024 W Hz-1). Our results are consistent with the most disturbed gas kinematics being induced by compact radio cores (rather than powerful radio jets), although broadened [O III] lambda5007 lines are also present, but much rarer, in low-L1.4 GHz systems. Our catalogue of multicomponent fits is freely available as an online resource for statistical studies of the kinematics and luminosities of the narrow- and broad-line AGN regions and the identification of potential targets for follow-up observations at http://sites.google.com/site/sdssalpaka.},

@article{Boroson:2005cr,
  abstract = {The [O III] lambda5007 line is commonly used as an indicator of the systemic redshift of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Also, recent studies have used the width of this emission line as a proxy for the stellar velocity dispersion in the host galaxy. This paper calls both of these assumptions into question by analyzing a sample of approximately 400 AGN spectra from the first data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These spectra show that the low-ionization forbidden lines ([O II], [N II], and [S II]) define a consistent redshift but that the peak of the [O III] line is blueshifted in approximately half of the AGNs with respect to that redshift. For the sample studied here, the average shift is 40 km s-1, with the largest shift being more than 400 km s-1. The magnitude of this shift is found to be correlated with a number of properties, including the width of the [O III] line and the Eddington ratio (L/LEdd), derived from the luminosity and width of Hbeta.},

@article{Tombesi:2010rr,
  abstract = {Context. Blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines have been detected in recent years between 7 and 10 keV in the X-ray spectra of several radio-quiet AGNs. The derived blue-shifted velocities of the lines can often reach mildly relativistic values, up to 0.2-0.4c. These findings are important because they suggest the presence of a previously unknown massive and highly ionized absorbing material outflowing from their nuclei, possibly connected with accretion disk winds/outflows.  Aims: The scope of the present work is to statistically quantify the parameters and incidence of the blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines through a uniform analysis on a large sample of radio-quiet AGNs. This allows us to assess their global detection significance and to overcome any possible publication bias.  Methods: We performed a blind search for narrow absorption features at energies greater than 6.4 keV in a sample of 42 radio-quiet AGNs observed with XMM-Newton. A simple uniform model composed by an absorbed power-law plus Gaussian emission and absorption lines provided a good fit for all the data sets. We derived the absorption lines parameters and calculated their detailed detection significance making use of the classical F-test and extensive Monte Carlo simulations.  Results: We detect 36 narrow absorption lines on a total of 101 XMM-Newton EPIC pn observations. The number of absorption lines at rest-frame energies higher than 7 keV is 22. Their global probability to be generated by random fluctuations is very low, less than 3 × 10-8, and their detection have been independently confirmed by a spectral analysis of the MOS data, with associated random probability <10-7. We identify the lines as Fe XXV and Fe XXVI K-shell resonant absorption. They are systematically blue-shifted, with a velocity distribution ranging from zero up to ~0.3c, with a peak and mean value at ~0.1c. We detect variability of the lines on both EWs and blue-shifted velocities among different XMM-Newton observations even on time-scales as short as a few days, possibly suggesting somewhat compact absorbers. Moreover, we find no significant correlation between the cosmological red-shifts of the sources and the lines blue-shifted velocities, ruling out any systematic contamination by local absorption. If we define ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) those highly ionized absorbers with outflow velocities higher than 104 km s-1, then the majority of the lines are consistent with being associated to UFOs and the fraction of objects with detected UFOs in the whole sample is at least ~35%. This fraction is similar for type 1 and type 2 sources. The global covering fraction of the absorbers is consequently estimated to be in the range C ˜ 0.4-0.6, thereby implying large opening angles.  Conclusions: From our systematic X-ray spectral analysis on a large sample of radio-quiet AGNs we have been able to clearly assess the global veracity of the blue-shifted Fe K absorption lines at E > 7 keV and to overcome their publication bias. These lines indicate that UFOs are a rather common phenomenon observable in the central regions of these sources and they are probably the direct signature of AGN accretion disk winds/ejecta. The detailed photo-ionization modeling of these absorbers is presented in a companion paper.  Appendices are only available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

  abstract = {Following the discovery of X-ray absorption in a high-velocity outflow from the bright quasar PG 1211 + 143 we have searched for similar features in XMM-Newton archival data of a second (high accretion rate) quasar PG 0844+349. Evidence is found for several faint absorption lines in both the EPIC and RGS spectra, whose most likely identification with resonance transitions in H-like Fe, S and Ne implies an origin in highly ionized matter with an outflow velocity of order ~0.2c. The line equivalent widths require a line-of-sight column density of NH~ 4 × 1023 cm-2, at an ionization parameter of log xi~ 3.7. Assuming a radial outflow being driven by radiation pressure from the inner accretion disc, as suggested previously for PG 1211 + 143, the flow in PG 0844+349 is also likely to be optically thick, in this case within ~25 Schwarzschild radii. Our analysis suggests that a high-velocity, highly ionized outflow is likely to be a significant component in the mass and energy budgets of active galactic nuclei accreting at or above the Eddington rate.},

@article{Young:2007lq,
  abstract = {It is now widely accepted that most galaxies undergo an active phase, during which a central super-massive black hole generates vast radiant luminosities through the gravitational accretion of gas. Winds launched from a rotating accretion disk surrounding the black hole are thought to play a critical role, allowing the disk to shed angular momentum that would otherwise inhibit accretion. Such winds are capable of depositing large amounts of mechanical energy in the host galaxy and its environs, profoundly affecting its formation and evolution, and perhaps regulating the formation of large-scale cosmological structures in the early Universe. Although there are good theoretical grounds for believing that outflows from active galactic nuclei originate as disk winds, observational verification has proven elusive. Here we show that structures observed in polarized light across the broad Halpha emission line in the quasar PG 1700+518 originate close to the accretion disk in an electron scattering wind. The wind has large rotational motions (~4,000kms-1), providing direct observational evidence that outflows from active galactic nuclei are launched from the disks. Moreover, the wind rises nearly vertically from the disk, favouring launch mechanisms that impart an initial acceleration perpendicular to the disk plane.},

@article{Veilleux:1991bh,
  abstract = {The results of the analysis of the line profiles presented in Paper I are reported. It is shown that the line-profile parameters derived from low- resolution data are often greatly affected by the finite width of the instrumental profile. These resolution effects generally result in overestimates of the line widths and underestimates of the line asymmetries. In spite of these important systematic errors, many of the results of low-resolution studies are confirmed in the high-resolution data. The narrow-line profiles of Seyfert galaxies have a stronger base relative to core than a Gaussian. Most of the emission lines present a blueward asymmetry in a lower portion of their profile. The widths of all of the emission lines are correlated with the emission-line/infrared/radio luminosities. None of the profile parameters correlates strongly with the reddening, ionization level, temperature, or density of the gas producing the narrow emission lines. The host galaxy probably plays a role in the kinematics of some of the gas in the narrow-line region. There is a tendency for galaxies with early morphological types to have broader and stubbier line profiles than objects of later types. A correlation is also observed between the [O III] line width and the luminosity of the galactic bulge.},

@article{Fabian:1999pd,
  abstract = {The mass density of massive black holes observed locally is consistent with the hard X-ray background provided that most of the radiation produced during their growth was absorbed by surrounding gas. A simple model is proposed here for the formation of galaxy bulges and central black holes in which young spheroidal galaxies have a significant distributed component of cold dusty clouds, which accounts for the absorption. The central accreting black hole is assumed to emit both a quasar-like spectrum, which is absorbed by the surrounding gas, and a slow wind. The power in both is less than the Eddington limit for the black hole. The wind, however, exerts the most force on the gas and, as earlier suggested by Silk & Rees, when the black hole reaches a critical mass it is powerful enough to eject the cold gas from the galaxy, so terminating the growth of both black hole and galaxy. In the present model this point occurs when the Thomson depth in the surrounding gas has dropped to about unity and results in the mass of the black hole being proportional to the mass of the spheroid, with the normalization agreeing with that found for local galaxies by Magorrian et al. for reasonable wind parameters. The model predicts a new population of hard X-ray and submm sources at redshifts above 1, which are powered by black holes in their main growth phase.},

@article{Gultekin:2009ul,
  abstract = {We derive improved versions of the relations between supermassive black hole mass (M BH) and host-galaxy bulge velocity dispersion (sigma) and luminosity (L; the M-sigma and M-L relations), based on 49 M BH measurements and 19 upper limits. Particular attention is paid to recovery of the intrinsic scatter (epsilon0) in both relations. We find log(M BH/M sun) = alpha + betalog(sigma/200 km s-1) with (alpha, beta, epsilon0) = (8.12 $\pm$ 0.08, 4.24 $\pm$ 0.41, 0.44 $\pm$ 0.06) for all galaxies and (alpha, beta, epsilon0) = (8.23 $\pm$ 0.08, 3.96 $\pm$ 0.42, 0.31 $\pm$ 0.06) for ellipticals. The results for ellipticals are consistent with previous studies, but the intrinsic scatter recovered for spirals is significantly larger. The scatter inferred reinforces the need for its consideration when calculating local black hole mass function based on the M-sigma relation, and further implies that there may be substantial selection bias in studies of the evolution of the M-sigma relation. We estimate the M-L relationship as log(M BH/M sun) = alpha + betalog(LV /1011 L sun,V ) of (alpha, beta, epsilon0) = (8.95 $\pm$ 0.11, 1.11 $\pm$ 0.18, 0.38 $\pm$ 0.09); using only early-type galaxies. These results appear to be insensitive to a wide range of assumptions about the measurement errors and the distribution of intrinsic scatter. We show that culling the sample according to the resolution of the black hole's sphere of influence biases the relations to larger mean masses, larger slopes, and incorrect intrinsic residuals.},

As expected, NIR bulge luminosities Lbul and BH masses are tightly correlated, and if we consider only those galaxies with a secure BH mass measurement and an accurate Lbul (27 objects), the spread of MBH-Lbul is similar to MBH-sigmae, where sigmae is the effective stellar velocity dispersion. We find an intrinsic rms scatter of ~=0.3 dex in logMBH. By combining the bulge effective radii Re measured in our analysis with sigmae, we find a tight linear correlation (rms~=0.25 dex) between MBH and the virial bulge mass (~Resigma2e), with <MBH/Mbul>~0.002. A partial correlation analysis shows that MBH depends on both sigmae and Re and that both variables are necessary to drive the correlations between MBH and other bulge properties.},

  abstract = {The masses of supermassive black holes correlate almost perfectly with the velocity dispersions of their host bulges, Mbh~sigmaalpha, where alpha=4.8+/-0.5. The relation is much tighter than the relation between Mbh and bulge luminosity, with a scatter no larger than expected on the basis of measurement error alone. Black hole masses recently estimated by Magorrian et al. lie systematically above the Mbh-sigma relation defined by more accurate mass estimates, some by as much as 2 orders of magnitude. The tightness of the Mbh-sigma relation implies a strong link between black hole formation and the properties of the stellar bulge.},

@article{Haring:2004ly,
  abstract = {We have reexamined the relation between the mass of the central black holes in nearby galaxies, Mbh, and the stellar mass of the surrounding spheroid or bulge, Mbulge. For a total of 30 galaxies bulge masses were derived through Jeans equation modeling or adopted from dynamical models in the literature. In stellar mass-to-light ratios, the spheroids and bulges span a range of a factor of 8. The bulge masses were related to well-determined black hole masses taken from the literature. With these improved values for Mbh, compared to Magorrian et al., and our redetermination of Mbulge, we find that the Mbh-Mbulge relation becomes very tight. We find Mbh~M1.12+/-0.06bulge with an observed scatter of <~0.30 dex, a fraction of which can be attributed to measurement errors. The scatter in this relation is therefore comparable to the scatter in the relations of Mbh with sigma and the stellar concentration. These results confirm and refine the work of Marconi & Hunt. For Mbulge~5×1010 Msolar the median black hole mass is 0.14%+/-0.04% of the bulge mass.},

Indirect arguments suggest but do not prove that these are supermassive black holes (BHs) like those postulated as quasar engines. This paper reviews dynamical search techniques, the robustness of the evidence, and BH demographics. Stellar-dynamical evidence is generally more robust than gas-dynamical evidence (gas velocities can be nongravitational), but gas measurements reach closer to the Schwarzschild radius, and in NGC 4258 they show a Keplerian rotation curve. A statistical survey finds BHs in $\sim 20\%$ of nearby E--Sbc galaxies, consistent with predictions based on quasar energetics. BH masses are proportional to the mass of the bulge component. Most candidates are inactive; in some cases, the abundance of fuel is not easily reconciled with BH starvation. Flashes caused by the accretion of individual stars may provide a test of the BH picture.},

@article{Fabian:2008zr,
  abstract = {Many active galactic nuclei (AGN) are surrounded by gas which absorbs the radiation produced by accretion on to the central black hole and obscures the nucleus from direct view. The dust component of the gas greatly enhances the effect of radiation pressure above that for Thomson scattering so that an AGN which is sub-Eddington for ionized gas in the usual sense can appear super-Eddington for cold dusty gas. The radiation pressure enhancement factor depends on the AGN spectrum but ranges between unity and about 500, depending on the column density. It means that an AGN for which the absorption is long-lived should have a column density of NH > 5 × 1023lambdacm-2, where lambda is its Eddington fraction Lbol/LEdd, provided that NH > 5 × 1021cm-2. We have compared the distribution of several samples of AGN - local, Chandra Deep Field-South and Lockman Hole - with this expectation and find good agreement. We show that the limiting enhancement factor can explain the black hole mass-bulge mass relation and note that the effect of radiation pressure on dusty gas may be a key component in the feedback of momentum and energy from a central black hole to a galaxy.},

  abstract = {Massive black holes (BHs) are at once exotic and yet ubiquitous, residing at the centers of massive galaxies in the local Universe. Recent years have seen remarkable advances in our understanding of how these BHs form and grow over cosmic time, during which they are revealed as Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). However, despite decades of research, we still lack a coherent picture of the physical drivers of BH growth, the connection between the growth of BHs and their host galaxies, the role of large-scale environment on the fueling of BHs, and the impact of BH-driven outflows on the growth of galaxies. In this paper we review our progress in addressing these key issues, motivated by the science presented at the What drives the growth of black holes? workshop held at Durham on 26-29th July 2010, and discuss how these questions may be tackled with current and future facilities.},

  abstract = {We present an evolutionary model for starbursts, quasars, and spheroidal galaxies in which mergers between gas-rich galaxies drive nuclear inflows of gas, producing starbursts and feeding the buried growth of supermassive black holes (BHs) until feedback expels gas and renders a briefly visible optical quasar. The quasar lifetime and obscuring column density depend on both the instantaneous and peak quasar luminosity, and we determine this dependence using a large set of galaxy merger simulations varying galaxy properties, orbital geometry, and gas physics. We use these fits to deconvolve observed quasar luminosity functions and obtain the evolution of the formation rate of quasars with peak luminosity, n dot(Lpeak,z). Quasars spend extended periods at luminosities well below peak, so n dot(Lpeak) has a maximum corresponding to the ``break'' in the observed luminosity function. From n dot(Lpeak) and our simulations, we obtain self-consistent hard and soft X-ray and optical luminosity functions and predict many observables at multiple redshifts, including column density distributions of optical and X-ray samples, the luminosity function of broad-line quasars in X-ray samples and broad-line fraction versus luminosity, active BH mass functions, the distribution of Eddington ratios, the mass function of relic BHs and total BH mass density, and the cosmic X-ray background. In every case, our predictions agree well with observed estimates, without invoking ad hoc assumptions about source properties or distributions. We provide a library of Monte Carlo realizations of our models for comparison with observations.},

@article{Springel:2005rt,
  abstract = {We describe techniques for incorporating feedback from star formation and black hole (BH) accretion into simulations of isolated and merging galaxies. At present, the details of these processes cannot be resolved in simulations on galactic scales. Our basic approach therefore involves forming coarse-grained representations of the properties of the interstellar medium (ISM) and BH accretion starting from basic physical assumptions, so that the impact of these effects can be included on resolved scales. We illustrate our method using a multiphase description of star-forming gas. Feedback from star formation pressurizes highly overdense gas, altering its effective equation of state (EOS). We show that this allows the construction of stable galaxy models with much larger gas fractions than possible in earlier numerical work. We extend the model by including a treatment of gas accretion onto central supermassive BHs in galaxies. Assuming thermal coupling of a small fraction of the bolometric luminosity of accreting BHs to the surrounding gas, we show how this feedback regulates the growth of BHs. In gas-rich mergers of galaxies, we observe a complex interplay between starbursts and central active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity when the tidal interaction triggers intense nuclear inflows of gas. Once an accreting supermassive BH has grown to a critical size, feedback terminates its further growth and expels gas from the central region in a powerful quasar-driven wind. Our simulation methodology is therefore able to address the coupled processes of gas dynamics, star formation and BH accretion during the formation of galaxies.},

  abstract = {The evidence for direct interactions between radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) and their surrounding gas is reviewed. New results from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey provide insightful information on the origin of radio-loud AGN activity, and allow study of the energetic influence of the radio-loud AGN on their surroundings, and the consequences of this for the accretion of gas onto elliptical galaxies. These results show that recurrent radio-loud AGN activity may provide a self-regulating feedback mechanism capable of controlling the rate of growth of galaxies. Finally, the effect of radio-loud AGN activity on gas at the scales of galaxy clusters is discussed.},

  abstract = {The properties of the host galaxies of a well-defined sample of 2215 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) with redshifts 0.03 < z < 0.3, defined from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), are investigated. These are predominantly low radio-luminosity sources, with 1.4-GHz luminosities in the range 1023-1025 WHz-1. The fraction of galaxies that host radio-loud AGN with L1.4GHz > 1023WHz-1 is a strong function of stellar mass, rising from nearly zero below a stellar mass of 1010Msolar to more than 30 per cent at stellar masses of 5 × 1011Msolar. In contrast to the integrated [OIII] luminosity density from emission-line AGN, which is mainly produced by black holes with masses below 108Msolar, the integrated radio luminosity density comes from the most massive black holes in the Universe. The integral radio luminosity function is derived in six ranges of stellar and black hole masses. Its shape is very similar in all of these ranges and can be well fitted by a broken power law. Its normalization varies strongly with mass, as M2.5* or M1.6BH; this scaling only begins to break down when the predicted radio-loud fraction exceeds 20-30 per cent. There is no correlation between radio and emission-line luminosities for the radio-loud AGN in the sample and the probability that a galaxy of given mass is radio loud is independent of whether it is optically classified as an AGN. The host galaxies of the radio-loud AGN have properties similar to those of ordinary galaxies of the same mass, with a tendency for radio-loud AGN to be found in larger galaxies and in richer environments. The host galaxies of radio-loud AGN with emission lines match those of their radio-quiet counterparts.  All of these findings support the conclusion that the optical AGN and low radio-luminosity AGN phenomena are independent and are triggered by different physical mechanisms. Intriguingly, the dependence on black hole mass of the radio-loud AGN fraction mirrors that of the rate at which gas cools from the hot atmospheres of elliptical galaxies. It is speculated that gas cooling provides a natural explanation for the origin of the radio-loud AGN activity, and it is argued that AGN heating could plausibly balance the cooling of the gas over time.},

@article{Croton:2006kx,
  abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance Lambda cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for `radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological `radio mode' model to be successful.},

Over 14 billion years of evolution, these ripples have been amplified to enormous proportions by gravitational forces, producing ever-growing concentrations of dark matter in which ordinary gases cool, condense and fragment to make galaxies. This process can be faithfully mimicked in large computer simulations, and tested by observations that probe the history of the Universe starting from just 400,000 years after the Big Bang.},

@article{Ciesla:2014qy,
  abstract = {We gather infrared (IR) photometric data from 8 to 500 microns (Spitzer, WISE, IRAS and Herschel) for all of the HRS galaxies. Draine & Li (2007) models are fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefully removed. We find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain all of the models parameters and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 microns range is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of the photo-dissociation regions to the IR SED. The SED models tend to systematically under-estimate the observed 500 microns flux densities, especially for low mass systems. We provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies: the minimum intensity of the interstellar radiation field (ISRF), the fraction of PAH, the relative contribution of PDR and evolved stellar population to the dust heating, the $M_{dust}$ and the $L_{IR}$. For a subsample of gas-rich galaxies, we analyze the relations between these parameters and the integrated properties of galaxies, such as $M_*$, SFR, metallicity, H$\alpha$ and H-band surface brightness, and the FUV attenuation. A good correlation between the fraction of PAH and the metallicity is found implying a weakening of the PAH emission in galaxies with low metallicities. The intensity of the IRSF and the H-band and H$\alpha$ surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dust component is heated by both the young stars in star forming regions and the diffuse evolved population. We use these results to provide a new set of IR templates calibrated with Herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a mean SED template to provide the z=0 reference for cosmological studies. For the same purpose, we put our sample on the SFR-$M_*$ diagram. The templates are compared to the most popular IR SED libraries, enlightening a large discrepancy between all of them in the 20-100 microns range.},

  abstract = {We present Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron integrated photometry for the 323 galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS), a K-band-, volume-limited sample of galaxies in the local Universe. Once combined with the Herschel/SPIRE observations already available, these data make the HRS the largest representative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the 100-500 micron wavelength range. In this paper, we take advantage of this unique dataset to investigate the properties and shape of the far-infrared/sub-millimeter spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. We show that, in the stellar mass range covered by the HRS (8<log(M*/Msun)<12), the far-infrared/sub-millimeter colours are inconsistent with a single modified black-body having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. In particular, either beta decreases, or multiple temperature components are needed, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies. We thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a single modified black-body depend on the assumptions made on beta. We show that, while the correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formation rate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are much more reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observed trends.},

@article{Gan:2014lr,
  abstract = {Based on two-dimensional high resolution hydrodynamic numerical simulation, we study the mechanical and radiative feedback effects from the central AGN on the cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy. Physical processes such as star formation and supernovae are considered. The inner boundary of the simulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is resolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined self-consistently. In analogy to previous works, we assume that the specific angular momentum of the galaxy is low. It is well-known that when the accretion rates are high and low, the central AGNs will be in cold and hot accretion modes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes, respectively. The emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than that from the cold accretion flows, which results in a higher Compton temperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating. Such a difference of the Compton temperature between the two feedback modes, the focus of this study, has been neglected in previous works. Significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are found as a result of the stronger Compton heating and accretion becomes more chaotic. More importantly, if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growth and AGN duty cycle after cosmological evolution, we find that the favored model parameters are constrained: mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes with decreasing luminosity (the maximum efficiency being $\simeq 10^{-3.5}$) and X-ray Compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity, although models with fixed mechanical efficiency and Compton temperature can be found that are satisfactory as well. We conclude that radiative feedback in the kinetic mode is much more important than previously thought.},

@article{Honig:2010fk,
  abstract = {In a series of papers, we aim at stepping towards characterizing physical properties of the AGN dust torus by combining IR high-spatial resolution observations with 3D clumpy torus models. In this first paper, we present mid-IR imaging and 8-13 mum low-resolution spectroscopy of nine type 1 and ten type 2 AGN. The observations were carried out with the VLT/VISIR mid-IR imager and spectrograph and can be considered the largest currently available mid-infrared spectro-photometric data set of AGN at spatial resolution ⪅100 pc. These data resolve scales at which the emission from the dust torus dominates the overall flux, and emission from the host galaxy (e.g. star-formation) is resolved out in most cases. The silicate absorption features are moderately deep and emission features, if seen at all, are shallow. The strongest silicate emission feature in our sample shows some notable shift of the central wavelength from the expected 9.7 mum (based on ISM extinction curves) to ~10.5 mum. We compare the observed mid-IR luminosities of our objects to AGN luminosity tracers (X-ray, optical and [O iii] luminosities) and find that the mid-IR radiation is emitted quite isotropically. In two cases, IC 5063 and MCG-3-34-64, we find evidence for extended dust emission in the narrow-line region. We confirm the correlation between observed silicate feature strength and Hydrogen column density, which was recently found in Spitzer data at lower spatial resolution. In a further step, our 3D clumpy torus model has been used to interpret the data. We show that the strength of the silicate feature and the mid-IR spectral index alpha can be used to get reasonable constraints on the radial dust distribution of the torus and the average number of clouds N0 along an equatorial line-of-sight in clumpy torus models. The mid-IR spectral index alpha is almost exclusively determined by the radial dust distribution power-law index a, while the silicate feature depth mostly depends on N0 and the torus inclination. A comparison of model predictions to our type 1 and type 2 AGN reveals that average parameters of a = -1.0$\pm$0.5 and N0 = 5-8 are typically seen in the presented sample, which means that the radial dust distribution is rather shallow. As a proof-of-concept of this method, we compared the model parameters derived from alpha and the silicate feature strength to more detailed studies of full IR SEDs and interferometry and found that the constraints on a and N0 are consistent. Finally, we may have found evidence that the radial structure of the torus changes from low to high AGN luminosities towards steeper dust distributions, and we discuss implications for the IR size-luminosity relation.  Based on ESO observing programs 078.B-0303, 080.B-0240, 280.B-5068, 082.B-0299, and 083.B-0239.},

@article{Honig:2010lr,
  abstract = {With the possibilities of high spatial resolution imaging and spectroscopy as well as infrared (IR) interferometry, the dusty environments (= ``dusty torus'') of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are now in reach of observations. Following our Paper I on ground-based mid-IR spectro-photometry, we present an upgrade to our radiative transfer model of three-dimensional clumpy dust tori. The upgrade with respect to earlier work concerns an improved handling of the diffuse radiation field in the torus, which is approximated by a statistical approach. The models are presented as tools to translate classical and interferometric observations into characteristic properties of the dust distribution. We compare model spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for different chemical and grain-size compositions of the dust and find that clouds with standard interstellar matter (ISM) dust and optical depth tauV ~ 50 appear in overall agreement with observed IR SEDs. By studying parameter dependencies, it is shown that type 1 AGN SEDs, in particular the mid-IR spectral index, can be used to constrain the radial dust cloud distribution power law index a, while other parameters are more difficult to assess using SEDs only. Interferometry adds important additional information for modeling when it is interpreted concurrently with the SED. Although type 2 AGN can in principle be used to constrain model parameters as well, obscuration effects make the analysis more ambiguous. We propose a simple, interferometry-based method to distinguish between ``compact'' and ``extended'' radial dust distributions without detailed modeling of the data and introduce a way to easily determine individual or sample average model parameters using the observed optical depth in the silicate feature and the mid-IR spectral index.},

  abstract = {The Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) is one of the three science instruments on ESA's far infrared and submillimetre observatory. It employs two Ge:Ga photoconductor arrays (stressed and unstressed) with 16×25 pixels, each, and two filled silicon bolometer arrays with 16×32 and 32×64 pixels, respectively, to perform integral-field spectroscopy and imaging photometry in the 60-210 mum wavelength regime. In photometry mode, it simultaneously images two bands, 60-85 mum or 85-125 mum and 125-210 mum, over a field of view of ~1.75'× 3.5', with close to Nyquist beam sampling in each band. In spectroscopy mode, it images a field of 47'' × 47'', resolved into 5×5 pixels, with an instantaneous spectral coverage of ~1500 km s-1 and a spectral resolution of ~175 km s-1. We summarise the design of the instrument, describe observing modes, calibration, and data analysis methods, and present our current assessment of the in-orbit performance of the instrument based on the performance verification tests. PACS is fully operational, and the achieved performance is close to or better than the pre-launch predictions.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

@article{Malkan:1998fr,
  abstract = {We have obtained WFPC2 images of 256 of the nearest (z <= 0.035) Seyfert 1, Seyfert 2, and starburst galaxies. Our 500 s broadband (F606W) exposures reveal much fine-scale structure in the centers of these galaxies, including dust lanes and patches, bars, rings, wisps, and filaments, and tidal features such as warps and tails. Most of this fine structure cannot be detected in ground-based images. We have assigned qualitative classifications for these morphological features and a Hubble type for the inner region of each galaxy, and we have also measured quantitative information such as 0.18 and 0.92 aperture magnitudes, position angles, and ellipticities, where possible. There is little direct evidence for unusually high rates of interaction in the Seyfert galaxies. Slightly less than 10% of all the galaxies show tidal features or multiple nuclei. The incidence of inner starburst rings is about 10% in both classes of Seyfert galaxies. In contrast, galaxies with H II region emission-line spectra appear substantially more irregular and clumpy because of their much higher rates of current star formation per unit of galactic mass. The presence of an unresolved central continuum source in our Hubble Space Telescope images is a virtually perfect indicator of a Seyfert 1 nucleus as seen by ground-based spectroscopy. Fifty-two percent of these Seyfert 1 point sources are saturated in our images; we use their wings to estimate magnitudes ranging from 15.8 to 18.5. The converse is not universally true, however, as over one-third of Seyferts with direct spectroscopic evidence for broad Balmer wings show no nuclear point source. These 34 resolved Seyfert 1's have fainter nonstellar nuclei, which appear to be more extinguished by dust absorption. Like the Seyfert 2's, they have central surface brightnesses consistent with those expected for the bulges of normal galaxies. The rates for the occurrences of bars in Seyfert 1's and 2's and non-Seyferts are the same. We found one significant morphological difference between the host galaxies of Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 nuclei. The Seyfert 2 galaxies are significantly more likely to show nuclear dust absorption, especially in lanes and patches that are irregular or reach close to the nucleus. A few simple tests show that the difference cannot be explained by different average redshifts or selection techniques. It is confirmed by our galaxy morphology classifications, which show that Seyfert 1 nuclei reside in earlier type galaxies than Seyfert 2 nuclei. If, as we believe, this is an intrinsic difference in host galaxy properties, it undermines one of the postulates of the strong unification hypothesis for Seyfert galaxies, that they merely appear different because of the orientation of their central engine. The excess galactic dust we see in Seyfert 2's may cause substantial absorption that obscures their hypothesized broad emission line regions and central nonstellar continua. This galactic dust could produce much of the absorption in Seyfert 2 nuclei that had instead been attributed to a thick dusty accretion torus forming the outer part of the central engine.},

@article{Zinn:2013ys,
  abstract = {Simulations of galaxy growth need to invoke strong negative feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to suppress the formation of stars and thus prevent the over-production of very massive systems. While some observations provide evidence for such negative feedback, other studies find either no feedback or even positive feedback, with increased star formation associated with higher AGN luminosities. Here we report an analysis of several hundred AGNs and their host galaxies in the Chandra Deep Field South using X-ray and radio data for sample selection. Combined with archival far-infrared data as a reliable tracer of star formation activity in the AGN host galaxies, we find that AGNs with pronounced radio jets exhibit a much higher star formation rate (SFR) than the purely X-ray-selected ones, even at the same X-ray luminosities. This difference implies that positive AGN feedback plays an important role, too, and therefore has to be accounted for in all future simulation work. We interpret this to indicate that the enhanced SFR of radio-selected AGNs arises because of jet-induced star formation, as is suggested by the different jet powers among our AGN samples, while the suppressed SFR of X-ray selected AGN is caused by heating and photo-dissociation of molecular gas by the hot AGN accretion disk.},

It consists of nine single-frequency catalogues of compact sources containing reliable sources, both Galactic and extragalactic, detected over the entire sky. The PCCS covers the frequency range between 30--857 GHz with higher sensitivity (it is 90% complete at 180 mJy in the best channel) and better angular resolution (from ~33' to ~5') than previous all-sky surveys in the microwave band. By definition its reliability is >80% and more than 65% of the sources have been detected at least in two contiguous Planck channels. The Planck PCCS sources have known associations to stars with dust shells, stellar cores, radio galaxies, blazars, infrared luminous galaxies and Galactic interstellar medium features. In this paper we present the construction and validation of the PCCS, its contents and its statistical characterization.},

@article{Wuyts:2011yq,
  abstract = {We compare multi-wavelength star formation rate (SFR) indicators out to z ~ 3 in the GOODS-South field. Our analysis uniquely combines U to 8 mum photometry from FIREWORKS, MIPS 24 mum and PACS 70, 100, and 160 mum photometry from the PEP, and Halpha spectroscopy from the SINS survey. We describe a set of conversions that lead to a continuity across SFR indicators. A luminosity-independent conversion from 24 mum to total infrared luminosity yields estimates of L IR that are in the median consistent with the L IR derived from PACS photometry, albeit with significant scatter. Dust correction methods perform well at low-to-intermediate levels of star formation. They fail to recover the total amount of star formation in systems with large SFRIR/SFRUV ratios, typically occuring at the highest SFRs (SFRUV + IR >~ 100 M sun yr-1) and redshifts (z >~ 2.5) probed. Finally, we confirm that Halpha-based SFRs at 1.5 < z < 2.6 are consistent with SFRSED and SFRUV + IR provided extra attenuation toward H II regions is taken into account (A  V, neb  = A  V, continuum/0.44). With the cross-calibrated SFR indicators in hand, we perform a consistency check on the star formation histories inferred from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. We compare the observed SFR-M relations and mass functions at a range of redshifts to equivalents that are computed by evolving lower redshift galaxies backward in time. We find evidence for underestimated stellar ages when no stringent constraints on formation epoch are applied in SED modeling. We demonstrate how resolved SED modeling, or alternatively deep UV data, may help to overcome this bias. The age bias is most severe for galaxies with young stellar populations and reduces toward older systems. Finally, our analysis suggests that SFHs typically vary on timescales that are long (at least several 100 Myr) compared to the galaxies' dynamical time.},

@article{Barro:2013kx,
  abstract = {We analyze the star-forming and structural properties of 45 massive (log(M/Msun)>10) compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 2<z<3 to explore whether they are progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z~2. The optical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs are heavily obscured. Nearly half (47%) host an X-ray bright AGN. In contrast, only about 10% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs have centrally-concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar to quiescent galaxies, and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs. Most compact SFGs lie either within the SFR-M main sequence (65%) or below (30%), on the expected evolutionary path towards quiescent galaxies. These results show conclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas and dust, quenching star formation. Using extensive HST photometry from CANDELS and grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey, we model their stellar populations with either exponentially declining (tau) star formation histories (SFHs) or physically-motivated SFHs drawn from semi-analytic models (SAMs). SAMs predict longer formation timescales and older ages ~2 Gyr, which are nearly twice as old as the estimates of the tau models. While both models yield good SED fits, SAM SFHs better match the observed slope and zero point of the SFR-M main sequence. Some low-mass compact SFGs (log(M/Msun)=10-10.6) have younger ages but lower sSFRs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that the low-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. If the progenitors of compact SFGs are extended SFGs, state-of-the-art SAMs show that mergers and disk instabilities are both able to shrink galaxies, but disk instabilities are more frequent (60% versus 40%) and form more concentrated galaxies. We confirm this result via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.},

  abstract = {The Herschel Reference Survey is a Herschel guaranteed time key project and will be a benchmark study of dust in the nearby universe. The survey will complement a number of other Herschel key projects including large cosmological surveys that trace dust in the distant universe. We will use Herschel to produce images of a statistically-complete sample of 323 galaxies at 250, 350, and 500 mum. The sample is volume-limited, containing sources with distances between 15 and 25 Mpc and flux limits in the  band to minimize the selection effects associated with dust and with young high-mass stars and to introduce a selection in stellar mass. The sample spans the whole range of morphological types (ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field to the center of the Virgo Cluster) and as such will be useful for other purposes than our own. We plan to use the survey to investigate (i) the dust content of galaxies as a function of Hubble type, stellar mass, and environment; (ii) the connection between the dust content and composition and the other phases of the interstellar medium; and (iii) the origin and evolution of dust in galaxies. In this article, we describe the goals of the survey, the details of the sample and some of the auxiliary observing programs that we have started to collect complementary data. We also use the available multifrequency data to carry out an analysis of the statistical properties of the sample.},

  abstract = {The relationships between galaxies of intermediate stellar mass and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 1<z<3 are investigated with the Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS) sample complemented with public data in the GOODS-South field. Using X-ray data, hidden AGNs are identified in unsuspected star-forming galaxies with no apparent signs of non-stellar activity. In the color-mass plane, two parallel trends emerge during the ~2 Gyr between the average redshifts z~2.2 and z~1.3: while the red sequence becomes significantly more populated by ellipticals, the majority of AGNs with L(2-10 keV)>10^42.3 erg s^-1 disappear from the blue cloud/green valley where they were hosted predominantly by star-forming systems with disk and irregular morphologies. These results are even clearer when the rest-frame colors are corrected for dust reddening. At z~2.2, the ultraviolet spectra of active galaxies (including two Type 1 AGNs) show possible gas outflows with velocities up to about -500 km s^-1 that are not observed neither in inactive systems at the same redshift, nor at lower redshifts. Such outflows indicate the presence of gas that can move faster than the escape velocities of active galaxies. These results suggest that feedback from moderately luminous AGNs (logL_X<44.5 erg s^-1) played a key role at z>~2 by contributing to outflows capable of ejecting part of the interstellar medium and leading to a rapid decrease in the star formation in host galaxies with stellar masses 10<logM<11 M_Sun.},

@article{Winter:2010qy,
  abstract = {Previous surveys of outflows in low-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have relied on the analysis of sources selected primarily for their optical/X-ray brightness and are therefore biased. Toward determining the outflow properties of local AGNs, we detect warm absorption signatures of O VII and O VIII absorption edges in the available Suzaku/XMM-Newton CCD spectra of an unbiased sample of 44 Seyfert 1-1.5 sources selected in the very hard X-rays (14-195 keV) with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope. From our analysis, we find that O VII and O VIII absorption edges are present in 41% of the sample. This fraction is dependent on luminosity, with outflow detections in 60% of low-luminosity and 30% of high-luminosity sources. However, grating spectroscopy of the highest luminosity sources reveals that ~80% of these sources have ionized absorbers, but that the ionization states are higher/lower than produces the O VII and O VIII edges. This suggests that ionized absorption may be present in all local Seyfert 1s.},

@article{Hoenig:2013lr,
  abstract = {X-ray surveys have revealed a new class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a very low observed fraction of scattered soft X-rays, f_scat < 0.5%. Based on X-ray modeling these X-ray new-type, or low observed X-ray scattering (hereafter:low-scattering) sources have been interpreted as deeply-buried AGN with a high covering factor of gas. In this paper we address the questions whether the host galaxies of low-scattering AGN may contribute to the observed X-ray properties, and whether we can find any direct evidence for high covering factors from the infrared (IR) emission. We find that X-ray low-scattering AGN are preferentially hosted by highly-inclined galaxies or merger systems as compared to other Seyfert galaxies, increasing the likelihood that the line-of-sight toward the AGN intersects with high columns of host-galactic gas and dust. Moreover, while a detailed analysis of the IR emission of low-scattering AGN ESO 103-G35 remains inconclusive, we do not find any indication of systematically higher dust covering factors in a sample of low-scattering AGN based on their IR emission. For ESO 103-G35, we constrained the temperature, mass and location of the IR emitting dust which is consistent with expectations for the dusty torus. However, a deep silicate absorption feature probably from much cooler dust suggests an additional screen absorber on larger scales within the host galaxy. Taking these findings together, we propose that the low f_scat observed in low-scattering AGN is not necessarily the result of circumnuclear dust but could originate from interference of host-galactic gas with a column density of the order of 10^22 cm^-2 with the line-of-sight. We discuss implications of this hypothesis for X-ray models, high-ionization emission lines, and observed star-formation activity in these objects.},

@article{Young:2013cr,
  abstract = {We present a study of the morphology and intensity of star formation in the host galaxies of eight Palomar-Green quasars using observations with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our observations are motivated by recent evidence for a close relationship between black hole growth and the stellar mass evolution in its host galaxy. We use narrow-band [O II] $\lambda$3727, H$\beta$, [O III] $\lambda$5007 and Pa$\alpha$ images, taken with the WFPC2 and NICMOS instruments, to map the morphology of line-emitting regions, and, after extinction corrections, diagnose the excitation mechanism and infer star-formation rates. Significant challenges in this type of work are the separation of the quasar light from the stellar continuum and the quasar-excited gas from the star-forming regions. To this end, we present a novel technique for image decomposition and subtraction of quasar light. Our primary result is the detection of extended line-emitting regions with sizes ranging from 0.5 to 5 kpc and distributed symmetrically around the nucleus, powered primarily by star formation. We determine star-formation rates of order a few tens of M$_\odot$/yr. The host galaxies of our target quasars have stellar masses of order $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ and specific star formation rates on a par with those of M82 and luminous infrared galaxies. As such they fall at the upper envelope or just above the star-formation mass sequence in the specific star formation vs stellar mass diagram. We see a clear trend of increasing star formation rate with quasar luminosity, reinforcing the link between the growth of the stellar mass of the host and the black hole mass found by other authors.},

We describe the construction of convolution kernels that allow one to generate (multiwavelength) images with a common PSF, thus preserving the colors of the astronomical sources. We generate convolution kernels for the cameras of Spitzer, Herschel Space Observatory, Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), ground-based optical telescopes (Moffat functions and sum of Gaussians), and Gaussian PSFs. Kernels for other telescopes including IRAS, AKARI, and Planck, are currently being constructed. These kernels allow the study of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of extended objects, preserving the characteristic SED in each pixel. The convolution kernels and the IDL packages used to construct and use them are made publicly available.},

  abstract = {New far-infrared and submillimeter photometry from the Herschel Space Observatory is presented for 61 nearby galaxies from the Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH) sample. The spatially integrated fluxes are largely consistent with expectations based on Spitzer far-infrared photometry and extrapolations to longer wavelengths using popular dust emission models. Dwarf irregular galaxies are notable exceptions, as already noted by other authors, as their 500 mum emission shows evidence for a submillimeter excess. In addition, the fraction of dust heating attributed to intense radiation fields associated with photodissociation regions is found to be (21 $\pm$ 4)% larger when Herschel data are included in the analysis. Dust masses obtained from the dust emission models of Draine & Li are found to be on average nearly a factor of two higher than those based on single-temperature modified blackbodies, as single blackbody curves do not capture the full range of dust temperatures inherent to any galaxy. The discrepancy is largest for galaxies exhibiting the coolest far-infrared colors.},

  abstract = {The Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) is a guaranteed time Herschel key project aimed at studying the physical properties of the interstellar medium in galaxies of the nearby universe. This volume limited, K-band selected sample is composed of galaxies spanning the whole range of morphological types (from ellipticals to late-type spirals) and environments (from the field to the centre of the Virgo Cluster). We present flux density measurements of the whole sample of 323 galaxies of the HRS in the three bands of the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE), at 250 mum, 350 mum and 500 mum. Aperture photometry is performed on extended galaxies and point spread function (PSF) fitting on timeline data for unresolved objects; we carefully estimate errors and upper limits. The flux densities are found to be in good agreement with those of the HeViCS and KINGFISH key projects in all SPIRE bands, and of the Planck consortium at 350 mum and 550 mum, for the galaxies in common. This submillimetre catalogue of nearby galaxies is a benchmark for the study of the dust properties in the local universe, giving the zero redshift reference for any cosmological survey.

@article{Nayakshin:2013fv,
  abstract = {We study effects of AGN feedback outflows on multi-phase inter stellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. We argue that SMBH growth is dominated by accretion of dense cold clumps and filaments. AGN feedback outflows overtake the cold medium, compress it, and trigger a powerful starburst -- a positive AGN feedback. This predicts a statistical correlation between AGN luminosity and star formation rate at high luminosities. Most of the outflow's kinetic energy escapes from the bulge via low density voids. The cold phase is pushed outward only by the ram pressure (momentum) of the outflow. The combination of the negative and positive forms of AGN feedback leads to an $M-\sigma$ relation similar to the result of King (2003). Due to porosity of cold ISM in the bulge, SMBH influence on the low density medium of the host galaxy is significant even for SMBH well below the $M-\sigma$ mass. The role of SMBH feedback in our model evolves in space and time with the ISM structure. In the early gas rich phase, SMBH accelerates star formation in the bulge. During later gas poor (red-and-dead) phases, SMBH feedback is mostly negative everywhere due to scarcity of the cold ISM.},

@article{Hopkins:2013yg,
  abstract = {Recent observations have indicated that a large fraction of the low to intermediate luminosity AGN population lives in disk-dominated hosts, while the more luminous quasars live in bulge-dominated hosts, in conflict with some previous model predictions. We therefore build and compare a semi-empirical model for AGN fueling which accounts for both merger and non-merger 'triggering.' In particular, we show that the 'stochastic accretion' model - in which fueling in disk galaxies is essentially a random process arising whenever dense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the present observations at low/intermediate luminosities. However it falls short of the high-luminosity population. We combine this with models for major merger-induced AGN fueling, which lead to rarer but more luminous events, and predict the resulting abundance of disk-dominated and bulge-dominated AGN host galaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift. We compile and compare observational constraints from z~0-2. The models and observations generically show a transition from disk to bulge dominance in hosts near the Seyfert-quasar transition, at all redshifts. 'Stochastic' fueling dominates AGN by number (dominant at low luminosity), and dominates BH growth below the knee in the present-day BH mass function (<10^7 M_sun). However it accounts for just ~10% of BH mass growth at masses >10^8 M_sun. In total, fueling in disky hosts accounts for ~30% of the total AGN luminosity density/BH mass density. The combined model also accurately predicts the AGN luminosity function and clustering/bias as a function of luminosity and redshift; however, we argue that these are not sensitive probes of BH fueling mechanisms.},

  abstract = {[Abridged] We study the evolution of the dust temperatures of galaxies in the SFR-M* plane up to z~2 using observations from the Herschel Space Observatory. Starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses (M*) and redshift estimates, we grid the SFR-M* parameter space in several redshift ranges and estimate the mean Tdust of each SFR-M*-z bin. Dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities of our SFR-M*-z bins. At all redshifts, Tdust increases with infrared luminosities (LIR), specific SFRs (SSFR; i.e., SFR/M*) and distances with respect to the main sequence (MS) of the SFR-M* plane (i.e., D_SSFR_MS=log[SSFR(galaxy)/SSFR_MS(M*,z)]). The Tdust-SSFR and Tdust-D_SSFR_MS correlations are statistically more significant than the Tdust-LIR one. While the slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, their normalizations evolve from z=0 and z~2. We convert these results into a recipe to derive Tdust from SFR, M* and z. The existence of a strong Tdust-D_SSFR_MS correlation provides us with information on the dust and gas content of galaxies. (i) The slope of the Tdust-D__SSFR_MS correlation can be explained by the increase of the star-formation efficiency (SFE; SFR/Mgas) with D_SSFR_MS as found locally by molecular gas studies. (ii) At fixed D_SSFR_MS, the constant Tdust observed in galaxies probing large ranges in SFR and M* can be explained by an increase or decrease of the number of star-forming regions with comparable SFE enclosed in them. (iii) At high redshift, the normalization towards hotter temperature of the Tdust-D_SSFR_MS correlation can be explained by the decrease of the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase of the SFE of MS galaxies. All these results support the hypothesis that the conditions prevailing in the star-forming regions of MS and far-above-MS galaxies are different.},

  abstract = {The Herschel Space Observatory  is the fourth cornerstone mission in the ESA science programme and performs photometry and spectroscopy in the 55 - 672 micron range. The development of the Herschel Data Processing System started in 2002 to support the data analysis  for Instrument Level Tests. The Herschel Data Processing  System was used for the pre-flight characterisation of the instruments, and during various ground segment test campaigns. Following the successful launch of Herschel 14th of May 2009 the Herschel Data Processing System demonstrated its maturity when the first PACS preview observation of M51 was processed within 30 minutes of reception of the first science data after launch. Also the first HIFI observations on DR21 were successfully reduced to high quality spectra, followed by SPIRE observations on M66 and M74. A fast turn-around cycle between data retrieval and the production of science-ready products was demonstrated during the Herschel Science Demonstration Phase Initial Results Workshop held 7 months after launch, which is a clear proof that the system has reached a good level of maturity. We will summarise the scope, the management and development methodology of the Herschel Data Processing system, present some key software elements and give an overview about the current status and future development milestones.},

Herschel carries a 3.5 m diameter passively cooled Cassegrain telescope, which is the largest of its kind and utilises a novel silicon carbide technology. The science payload comprises three instruments: two direct detection cameras/medium resolution spectrometers, PACS and SPIRE, and a very high-resolution heterodyne spectrometer, HIFI, whose focal plane units are housed inside a superfluid helium cryostat. Herschel is an observatory facility operated in partnership among ESA, the instrument consortia, and NASA. The mission lifetime is determined by the cryostat hold time. Nominally approximately 20 000 h will be available for astronomy, 32% is guaranteed time and the remainder is open to the worldwide general astronomical community through a standard competitive proposal procedure.

@article{Griffin:2010sf,
  abstract = {The Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE), is the Herschel Space Observatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. It contains a three-band imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 mum, and an imaging Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) which covers simultaneously its whole operating range of 194-671 mum (447-1550 GHz). The SPIRE detectors are arrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a field of view of 4´× 8´, observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands. Its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned across the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if desired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a diameter of 2.6´. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25 GHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map areas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold focal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

Based on morphological classifications from the RC3 and the Galaxy Zoo, the bluer colors of BAT AGNs are mainly due to a higher fraction of mergers and massive spirals than in the comparison samples. BAT AGNs in massive galaxies (log M * >10.5) have a 5-10 times higher rate of spiral morphologies than in SDSS AGNs or inactive galaxies. We also see enhanced far-infrared emission in BAT AGN suggestive of higher levels of star formation compared to the comparison samples. BAT AGNs are preferentially found in the most massive host galaxies with high concentration indexes indicative of large bulge-to-disk ratios and large supermassive black holes. The narrow-line (NL) BAT AGNs have similar intrinsic luminosities as the SDSS NL Seyferts based on measurements of [O III] lambda5007. There is also a correlation between the stellar mass and X-ray emission. The BAT AGNs in mergers have bluer colors and greater ultra hard X-ray emission compared to the BAT sample as a whole. In agreement with the unified model of AGNs, and the relatively unbiased nature of the BAT sources, the host galaxy colors and morphologies are independent of measures of obscuration such as X-ray column density or Seyfert type. The high fraction of massive spiral galaxies and galaxy mergers in BAT AGNs suggest that host galaxy morphology is related to the activation and fueling of local AGN.},

  abstract = {The Swift Burst Alert Telescope survey of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is providing an unprecedented view of local AGNs (langzrang ≈ 0.03) and their host galaxy properties. In this paper, we present an analysis of the optical spectra of a sample of 64 AGNs from the nine month survey, detected solely based on their 14-195 keV flux. Our analysis includes both archived spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and our own observations from the 2.1 m Kitt Peak National Observatory telescope. Among our results, we include line ratio classifications utilizing standard emission line diagnostic plots, [O III] 5007 {\AA} luminosities, and Hbeta-derived black hole masses. As in our X-ray study, we find the type 2 sources to be less luminous (in [O III] 5007 {\AA} and 14-195 keV luminosities) with lower accretion rates than the type 1 sources. We find that the optically classified low-ionization narrow emission line regions, H II/composite galaxies, and ambiguous sources have the lowest luminosities, while both broad-line and narrow-line Seyferts have similar luminosities. From a comparison of the hard X-ray (14-195 keV) and [O III] luminosities, we find that both the observed and extinction-corrected [O III] luminosities are weakly correlated with X-ray luminosity. In a study of the host galaxy properties from both continuum fits and measurements of the stellar absorption indices, we find that the hosts of the narrow-line sources have properties consistent with late-type galaxies.},

  abstract = {The 9-month Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) catalog provides the first unbiased (NH < 1024 cm-2) look at local (langzrang = 0.03) active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In this paper, we present the collected X-ray properties (0.3-12 keV) for the 153 AGNs detected. In addition, we examine the X-ray properties for a complete sample of nonbeamed sources, above the Galactic plane (b >= 15$\,^{\circ}$). Of these, 45% are best fit by simple power law models, while 55% require the more complex partial covering model. One of our goals was to determine the fraction of hidden AGNs, which we define as sources with scattering fractions less than or equal to 0.03 and ratios of soft to hard X-ray flux less than or equal to 0.04. We found that hidden AGNs constitute a high percentage of the sample (24%), proving that they are a very significant portion of local AGNs. Further, we find that the fraction of absorbed sources does increase at lower unabsorbed 2-10 keV luminosities, as well as accretion rates. This suggests that the unified model requires modification to include luminosity dependence, as suggested by models such as the receding torus model. Some of the most interesting results for the BAT AGN sample involve the host galaxy properties. We found that 33% are hosted in peculiar/irregular galaxies and only 5/74 are hosted in ellipticals. Further, 54% are hosted in interacting/merger galaxies. Finally, we present both the average X-ray spectrum (0.1-10 keV) and log N-log S in the 2-10 keV band. With our average spectrum, we have the remarkable result of reproducing the measured CXB X-ray power law slope of Gamma ≈ 1.4. From the log N-log S relationship, we show that we are complete to log S >= -11 in the 2-10 keV band. Below this value, we are missing as many as 3000 sources at log S = -12. Both the collected X-ray properties of our uniform sample and the log N-log S relationship will now provide valuable input to X-ray background models for z ≈ 0.},

  abstract = {We study the star formation rate (SFR)-stellar mass (M sstarf) relation in a self-consistent manner from 0 < z < 2.5 with 22,816 star-forming galaxies selected from the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey. We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with normal dust obscuration and associated colors (54% for log (M sstarf) > 10 at 1 < z < 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11%), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7%). The remaining 28% comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the normal star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

  abstract = {We report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive (> 10^11 Msun) z~2 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which are plausibly driven by an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). The sample consists of the eight most massive SFGs from our SINS/zC-SINF survey of galaxy kinematics with the imaging spectrometer SINFONI, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptive optics (AO) assisted observations. All of the objects are disks hosting a significant stellar bulge. The spectra in their central regions exhibit a broad component in Halpha and forbidden [NII] and [SII] line emission, with typical velocity FWHM ~ 1500 km/s, [NII]/Halpha ratio ~ 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2 - 3 kpc. These properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflows associated with Type 2 AGN, the presence of which is confirmed via independent diagnostics in half the galaxies. The data imply a median ionized gas mass outflow rate of ~ 60 Msun/yr and mass loading of ~ 3. At larger radii, a weaker broad component is detected but with lower FWHM ~ 485 km/s and [NII]/Halpha ~ 0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in the lower-mass SINS/zC-SINF galaxies. The high inferred mass outflow rates and frequent occurrence suggest the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out of the centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles, and may thus contribute to the process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. Larger samples at high masses will be crucial to confirm the importance and energetics of the nuclear outflow phenomenon, and its connection to AGN activity and bulge growth.},

@article{Diaz-Santos:2010vn,
  abstract = {We present an analysis of the extended mid-infrared (MIR) emission of the Great Observatories All-Sky LIRG Survey sample based on 5-15 mum low-resolution spectra obtained with the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitzer. We calculate the fraction of extended emission (FEE) as a function of wavelength for the galaxies in the sample, FEElambda, defined as the fraction of the emission which originates outside of the unresolved component of a source at a given distance. We find that the FEElambda varies from one galaxy to another, but we can identify three general types of FEElambda: one where FEElambda is constant, one where features due to emission lines and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons appear more extended than the continuum, and a third which is characteristic of sources with deep silicate absorption at 9.7 mum. More than 30% of the galaxies have a median FEElambda larger than 0.5, implying that at least half of their MIR emission is extended. Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) display a wide range of FEE in their warm dust continuum (0 <~ FEE13.2 mum <~ 0.85). The large values of FEE13.2 mum that we find in many LIRGs suggest that the extended component of their MIR continuum emission originates in scales up to 10 kpc and may contribute as much as the nuclear region to their total MIR luminosity. The mean size of the LIRG cores at 13.2 mum is 2.6 kpc. However, once the IR luminosity of the systems reaches the threshold of L IR ~ 1011.8 L sun, slightly below the regime of Ultra-luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), all sources become clearly more compact, with FEE13.2 mum <~ 0.2, and their cores are unresolved. Our estimated upper limit for the core size of ULIRGs is less than 1.5 kpc. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the compactness of systems with L IR >~ 1011.25 L sun strongly increases in those classified as mergers in their final stage of interaction. The FEE13.2 mum is also related to the contribution of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) to the MIR emission. Galaxies which are more AGN dominated are less extended, independently of their L IR. We finally find that the extent of the MIR continuum emission is correlated with the far-IR IRAS log(f 60 mum/f 100 mum) color. This enables us to place a lower limit to the area in a galaxy from where the cold dust emission may originate, a prediction which can be tested soon with the Herschel Space Telescope.},

@article{Winter:2012yq,
  abstract = {We present results from an analysis of the broadband, 0.3-195 keV, X-ray spectra of 48 Seyfert 1-1.5 sources detected in the very hard X-rays with the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT). This sample is selected in an all-sky survey conducted in the 14-195 keV band. Therefore, our sources are largely unbiased toward both obscuration and host galaxy properties. Our detailed and uniform model fits to Suzaku/BAT and XMM-Newton/BAT spectra include the neutral absorption, direct power-law, reflected emission, soft excess, warm absorption, and narrow Fe I Kalpha emission properties for the entire sample. We significantly detect O VII and O VIII edges in 52% of our sample. The strength of these detections is strongly correlated with the neutral column density measured in the spectrum. Among the strongest detections, X-ray grating and UV observations, where available, indicate outflowing material. The ionized column densities of sources with O VII and O VIII detections are clustered in a narrow range with N warm ~ 1021 cm-2, while sources without strong detections have column densities of ionized gas an order of magnitude lower. Therefore, we note that sources without strong detections likely have warm ionized outflows present but at low column densities that are not easily probed with current X-ray observations. Sources with strong complex absorption have a strong soft excess, which may or may not be due to difficulties in modeling the complex spectra of these sources. Still, the detection of a flat Gamma ~ 1 and a strong soft excess may allow us to infer the presence of strong absorption in low signal-to-noise active galactic nucleus spectra. Additionally, we include a useful correction from the Swift BAT luminosity to bolometric luminosity, based on a comparison of our spectral fitting results with published spectral energy distribution fits from 33 of our sources.},

@article{Kroupa:2001qy,
  abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5Msolar and near 0.08Msolar. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices alpha are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by Deltaalpha~0.5 between 0.1 and 1Msolar than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto & Zoccali; Paresce & De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez & Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

@article{Kovacs:2010zr,
  abstract = {We present SHARC-2 350 mum data on 20 luminous z ~ 2 starbursts with S 1.2 mm > 2 mJy from the Spitzer-selected samples of Lonsdale et al. and Fiolet et al. All the sources were detected, with S 350 mum > 25 mJy for 18 of them. With the data, we determine precise dust temperatures and luminosities for these galaxies using both single-temperature fits and models with power-law mass-temperature distributions. We derive appropriate formulae to use when optical depths are non-negligible. Our models provide an excellent fit to the 6 mum-2 mm measurements of local starbursts. We find characteristic single-component temperatures T 1 ~= 35.5 $\pm$ 2.2 K and integrated infrared (IR) luminosities around 1012.9 $\pm$ 0.1 L sun for the SWIRE-selected sources. Molecular gas masses are estimated at sime4 × 1010 M sun, assuming kappa850 mum = 0.15 m2 kg-1 and a submillimeter-selected galaxy (SMG)-like gas-to-dust mass ratio. The best-fit models imply gsim2 kpc emission scales. We also note a tight correlation between rest-frame 1.4 GHz radio and IR luminosities confirming star formation as the predominant power source. The far-IR properties of our sample are indistinguishable from the purely submillimeter-selected populations from current surveys. We therefore conclude that our original selection criteria, based on mid-IR colors and 24 mum flux densities, provides an effective means for the study of SMGs at z ~ 1.5-2.5.},

@article{Murphy:2011rt,
  abstract = {Using free-free emission measured in the Ka band (26-40 GHz) for 10 star-forming regions in the nearby galaxy NGC 6946, including its starbursting nucleus, we compare a number of star formation rate (SFR) diagnostics that are typically considered to be unaffected by interstellar extinction. These diagnostics include non-thermal radio (i.e., 1.4 GHz), total infrared (IR; 8-1000 mum), and warm dust (i.e., 24 mum) emission, along with hybrid indicators that attempt to account for obscured and unobscured emission from star-forming regions including Halpha + 24 mum and UV + IR measurements. The assumption is made that the 33 GHz free-free emission provides the most accurate measure of the current SFR. Among the extranuclear star-forming regions, the 24 mum, Halpha + 24 mum, and UV + IR SFR calibrations are in good agreement with the 33 GHz free-free SFRs. However, each of the SFR calibrations relying on some form of dust emission overestimates the nuclear SFR by a factor of ~2 relative to the 33 GHz free-free SFR. This is more likely the result of excess dust heating through an accumulation of non-ionizing stars associated with an extended episode of star formation in the nucleus rather than increased competition for ionizing photons by dust. SFR calibrations using the non-thermal radio continuum yield values which only agree with the 33 GHz free-free SFRs for the nucleus and underestimate the SFRs from the extranuclear star-forming regions by an average factor of ~2 and ~4-5 before and after subtracting local background emission, respectively. This result likely arises from the cosmic-ray (CR) electrons decaying within the starburst region with negligible escape, whereas the transient nature of star formation in the young extranuclear star-forming complexes allows for CR electrons to diffuse significantly further than dust-heating photons, resulting in an underestimate of the true SFR. Finally, we find that the SFRs estimated using the total 33 GHz flux density appear to agree well with those estimated using free-free emission due to the large thermal fractions present at these frequencies even when local diffuse backgrounds are not removed. Thus, rest-frame 33 GHz observations may act as a reliable method to measure the SFRs of galaxies at increasingly high redshift without the need of ancillary radio data to account for the non-thermal emission.},

@article{Yun:2001vn,
  abstract = {The radio counterparts to the IRAS Redshift Survey galaxies are identified in the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) catalog. Our new catalog of the IR flux-limited (S60mum>=2 Jy) complete sample of 1809 galaxies lists accurate radio positions, redshifts, and 1.4 GHz radio and IRAS fluxes. This sample is 6 times larger in size and 5 times deeper in redshift coverage (to z~0.15) than those used in earlier studies of the radio and far-IR (FIR) properties of galaxies in the local volume. The well-known radio-FIR correlation is obeyed by the overwhelming majority (>=98%) of the IR-selected galaxies, and the radio AGNs identified by their excess radio emission constitute only about 1% of the sample, independent of the IR luminosity. These FIR-selected galaxies can account for the entire population of late-type field galaxies in the local volume, and their radio continuum may be used directly to infer the extinction-free star formation rate in most cases. Both the 1.4 GHz radio and 60 mum IR luminosity functions are reasonably well described by linear sums of two Schechter functions, one representing normal, late-type field galaxies and the other representing starbursts and other luminous IR galaxies. The integrated FIR luminosity density for the local volume is (4.8+/-0.5)×107 Lsolar Mpc-3, less than 10% of which is contributed by the luminous IR galaxies with LFIR>=1011 Lsolar. The inferred extinction-free star formation density for the local volume is 0.015+/-0.005 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3.},

@article{Rieke:2009yq,
  abstract = {We show that measures of star formation rates (SFRs) for infrared galaxies using either single-band 24 mum or extinction-corrected Paalpha luminosities are consistent in the total infrared luminosity = L(TIR) ~ 1010 L sun range. MIPS 24 mum photometry can yield SFRs accurately from this luminosity upward: SFR(M sun yr-1) = 7.8 × 10-10 L(24 mum, L sun) from L(TIR) = 5× 109 L sun to 1011 L sun and SFR = 7.8 × 10-10 L(24 mum, L sun)(7.76 × 10-11 L(24))0.048 for higher L(TIR). For galaxies with L(TIR) >= 1010 L sun, these new expressions should provide SFRs to within 0.2 dex. For L(TIR) >= 1011 L sun, we find that the SFR of infrared galaxies is significantly underestimated using extinction-corrected Paalpha (and presumably using any other optical or near-infrared recombination lines). As a part of this work, we constructed spectral energy distribution templates for eleven luminous and ultraluminous purely star forming infrared galaxies and over the spectral range 0.4 mum to 30 cm. We use these templates and the SINGS data to construct average templates from 5 mum to 30 cm for infrared galaxies with L(TIR) = 5× 109 to 1013 L sun. All of these templates are made available online.},

@article{Esquej:2013fj,
  abstract = {Recent theoretical and observational works indicate the presence of a correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and the active galactic nuclei (AGN) luminosity (and, therefore, the black hole accretion rate) of Seyfert galaxies. This suggests a physical connection between the gas forming stars on kpc scales and the gas on sub-pc scales that is feeding the black hole. We compiled the largest sample of Seyfert galaxies to date with high angular resolution (0.4-0.8 arcsec) mid-infrared (8-13 micron) spectroscopy. The sample includes 29 Seyfert galaxies drawn from the AGN Revised Shapley-Ames catalogue. At a median distance of 33 Mpc, our data allow us to probe nuclear regions on scales of 65 pc (median value). We found no general evidence of suppression of the 11.3 micron polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the vicinity of these AGN, and used this feature as a proxy for the SFR. We detected the 11.3 micron PAH feature in the nuclear spectra of 45% of our sample. The derived nuclear SFRs are, on average, five times lower than those measured in circumnuclear regions of 600 pc in size (median value). However, the projected nuclear SFR densities are a factor of 20 higher than those measured on circumnuclear scales. This indicates that the SF activity per unit area in the central 65 pc of Seyfert galaxies is much higher than at larger distances from their nuclei. We studied the connection between the nuclear SFR and the black hole accretion rate and showed that numerical simulations reproduce fairly well our observed relation.},

@article{Rashed:2013uq,
  abstract = {Context. Double-lobe radio galaxies are ideally suited to investigate the interaction of the individual components of the radio structure with the intergalactic medium and the interstellar medium of the host galaxy. SDSS J080800.99+483807.7 has been serendipitously discovered in MERLIN 18 cm observations to be a double-lobed radio galaxy. Because it is an optically faint source, basic information like redshift, linear size, and structure has been incomplete until now. Furthermore, there are no spectra of this source available in any databases.  Aims: The goal of this work is to derive the main physical properties of SDSS J080800.99+483807.7 and study the possible interaction between the radio jets and the interstellar medium of the host galaxy.  Methods: To achieve this goal, we used optical spectroscopy and radio interferometry. The radio data were obtained with MERLIN at 18 cm and the optical data with the Multi-Object Double Spectrograph (MODS) at the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT).  Results: The redshift of the galaxy is z = 0.2805 $\pm$ 0.0003, resulting in a linear size of the observed radio structure of ~26.3 kpc. The optical line emission as well as the infrared and radio continuum emission suggest a high star-formation activity. In addition, we estimated the mass of the central black hole to be log (MBH/M&sun;) ≈ 6.9.  Conclusions: The MODS spectrum and the optical images from Sloan Digital Sky Survey suggest that SDSS J080800.99+483807.7 is an elliptical host galaxy. In combination with the overall radio structure, we argue that the star formation could be the result of the back-flow along the jet and the interstellar medium of the host.},

@article{Zuther:2012qy,
  abstract = {Context. The radio and X-ray emission of active galctic nuclei (AGN) appears to be correlated. The details of the underlying physical processes, however, are still not fully understood, i.e., to what extent the X-ray and radio emission is originating from the same relativistic particles, or from the accretion-disk, or corona, or both.  Aims: We study the cm radio emission of an SDSS/ROSAT/FIRST matched sample of 13 X-raying AGN in the redshift range 0.11 <= z <= 0.37 at high angular resolution with the goal of searching for jet structures or diffuse, extended emission on sub-kpc scales.  Methods: We used MERLIN at 18 cm for all objects and Western EVN at 18 cm for four objects to study the radio emission on scales of ~500 pc and ~40 pc for the MERLIN and EVN observations, respectively.  Results: The detected emission is dominated by compact nuclear radio structures. We find no kpc collimated jet structures. The EVN data indicate compact nuclei on 40 pc scales, with brightness temperatures typical for accretion-disk scenarios. Comparison with FIRST data shows that the 18 cm emission is resolved out up to 50% by MERLIN. Star-formation rates based on large aperture SDSS spectra are generally too low to produce considerable contamination of the nuclear radio emission. We can, therefore, assume the 18 cm flux densities to be produced in the nuclei of the AGN. Together with the ROSAT soft X-ray luminosities and black-hole mass estimates from the literature, our sample objects closely follow the Merloni et al. fundamental plane relation, which appears to trace the accretion processes. Detailed X-ray spectral modeling from deeper hard X-ray observations and higher angular resolution at radio wavelengths are required to make more progress in separating jet and accretion related processes.

@article{Asmus:2013fk,
  abstract = {We present the first subarcsecond-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) atlas of local active galactic nuclei (AGN) containing 253 objects with a median redshift of z = 0.016. It comprises all available MIR imaging observations performed to date with ground-based 8-meter class telescopes and includes in total 895 independent photometric measurements, of which more than 60% are previously unpublished.We detect extended nuclear emission in at least 21% of the objects, while another 19% appear clearly point-like, and the remaining objects cannot be constrained. Subarcsecond resolution allows us to isolate the emission of the AGN on scales of a few tens of parsecs for the bulk of the sample and obtain nuclear photometry in multiple filters for the objects. The photometry is used to construct median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the different optical AGN types and estimate the individual MIR 12 and 18 um continuum luminosities, which range over more than six orders of magnitude. We also analyse the arcsecond-scale MIR emission as probed by Spitzer and compare it to the subarcsecond-scale emission. The continuum emission is on average 20% lower on subarcsecond scales with a large scatter that depends mostly on the object distance or luminosity. The silicate feature strength is similar on both scales and generally appears in emission (absorption) in type I (II) AGN. However, the PAH emission appears weaker or absent on subarcsecond scales, indicating that most of the star formation has been resolved out. The differences of the MIR SEDs on both scales are particularly large for AGN/starburst composites and close-by (and weak) AGN. Because of its size and characteristics, the AGN MIR atlas is well-suited not only for detailed investigation of individual sources but also for sample studies of AGN unification.},

  abstract = {We use the near-infrared Brgamma hydrogen recombination line as a reference star formation rate (SFR) indicator to test the validity and establish the calibration of the Herschel/PACS 70 mum emission as a SFR tracer for sub-galactic regions in external galaxies. Brgamma offers the double advantage of directly tracing ionizing photons and of being relatively insensitive to the effects of dust attenuation. For our first experiment, we use archival Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Brgamma and Ks images of two nearby galaxies: NGC 5055 and NGC 6946, which are also part of the Herschel program KINGFISH (Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: a Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel). We use the extinction corrected Brgamma emission to derive the SFR(70) calibration for H II regions in these two galaxies. A comparison of the SFR(70) calibrations at different spatial scales, from 200 pc to the size of the whole galaxy, reveals that about 50% of the total 70 mum emission is due to dust heated by stellar populations that are unrelated to the current star formation. We use a simple model to qualitatively relate the increase of the SFR(70) calibration coefficient with decreasing region size to the star formation timescale. We provide a calibration for an unbiased SFR indicator that combines the observed Halpha with the 70 mum emission, also for use in H II regions. We briefly analyze the PACS 100 and 160 mum maps and find that longer wavelengths are not as good SFR indicators as 70 mum, in agreement with previous results. We find that the calibrations show about 50% difference between the two galaxies, possibly due to effects of inclination.

  abstract = {We compare [O IV] 25.89 mum emission line luminosities with very hard (10-200 keV) X-rays from Swift, INTEGRAL, and BeppoSAX for a complete sample of 89 Seyferts from the Revised Shapley-Ames sample. Using Seyfert 1s, we calibrate [O IV] as a measure of active galactic nucleus (AGN) intrinsic luminosity, for particular use in high-obscuration environments. With this calibration, we measure the average decrement in 14-195 keV X-ray to [O IV] luminosity ratio for Seyfert 2s compared to type 1s. We find a decrement of 3.1 $\pm$ 0.8 for Seyfert 2s, and a decrement of 5.0 $\pm$ 2.7 for known Compton-thick Seyfert 2s. These decrements imply column densities of approximately log NH = 24.6 cm-2 and 24.7 cm-2, respectively. Thus, we infer that the average Seyfert 2 is more highly obscured and intrinsically more luminous than would be inferred even from the very hard X-rays. We demonstrate two applications of the hard X-ray to [O IV] ratio. For the extremely obscured NGC 1068, we measure a column density of log NH = 25.3-25.4 cm-2. Finally, by comparing [O IV] luminosities to total infrared luminosities for 12 bright ultraluminous infrared galaxies, we find that four have substantial AGN contributions.},

  abstract = {We study a combined sample of 264 star-forming, 51 composite, and 73 active galaxies using optical spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and mid-infrared (mid-IR) spectra from the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph. We examine optical and mid-IR spectroscopic diagnostics that probe the amount of star formation and relative energetic contributions from star formation and an active galactic nucleus (AGN). Overall we find good agreement between optical and mid-IR diagnostics. Misclassifications of galaxies based on the SDSS spectra are rare despite the presence of dust obscuration. The luminosity of the [Ne II] 12.8 mum emission line is well correlated with the star formation rate measured from the SDSS spectra, and this holds for the star-forming, composite, and AGN-dominated systems. AGNs show a clear excess of [Ne III] 15.6 mum emission relative to star-forming and composite systems. We find good qualitative agreement between various parameters that probe the relative contributions of the AGN and star formation, including the mid-IR spectral slope, the ratio of the [Ne V] 14.3 mum to [Ne II] mum 12.8 fluxes, the equivalent widths of the 7.7 mum, 11.3 mum, and 17 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features, and the optical D parameter which measures the distance at which a source lies from the locus of star-forming galaxies in the optical BPT emission-line diagnostic diagram. We also consider the behavior of the three individual PAH features by examining how their flux ratios depend upon the degree of AGN dominance. We find that the PAH 11.3 mum feature is significantly suppressed in the most AGN-dominated systems.},

@article{Kormendy:2013fj,
  abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass [Formula: see text] and the velocity dispersion sigma of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from [Formula: see text] in brightest cluster ellipticals to [Formula: see text] in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade.   New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106M&sun; are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any [Formula: see text] correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution.   The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with [Formula: see text] suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between [Formula: see text] and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in [Formula: see text] correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.},

@article{Cid-Fernandes:2001uq,
  abstract = {We examine a representative sample of 35 Seyfert 2 nuclei. Previous work has shown that nearly half (15) of these nuclei show the direct (but difficult to detect) spectroscopic signature at optical/near-UV wavelengths of the hot massive stars that power circumnuclear starbursts. In the present paper we examine a variety of more easily measured quantities for this sample, such as the equivalent widths of strong absorption features, continuum colors, emission line equivalent widths, emission line ratios and profiles, far-IR luminosities, and near-UV surface brightness. We compare the composite starburst+Seyfert 2 nuclei to ``pure'' Seyfert 2 nuclei, Starburst galaxies, and normal galactic nuclei. Our goals are to verify whether the easily measured properties of the composite nuclei are consistent with the expected impact of a starburst and to investigate alternative less demanding methods to infer the presence of starbursts in Seyfert 2 nuclei, applicable to larger or more distant samples. We show that starbursts do indeed leave clear and easily quantifiable imprints on the near-UV to optical continuum and emission line properties of Seyfert 2's. Composite starburst+Seyfert 2 systems can be recognized by: (1) a strong ``featureless continuum'' (FC), which dilutes the Ca II K line from old stars in the host's bulge to an equivalent width WK<10 {\AA} (2) emission lines whose equivalent widths are intermediate between starburst galaxies and ``pure'' Seyfert 2's (3) relatively low excitation line ratios, which indicate that part of the gas ionization in these Seyfert 2's (typically ~50% of Hbeta) is due to photoionization by OB stars; (4) large far-IR luminosities (>~1010 Lsolar) (5) high near-UV surface brightness (~103 Lsolar pc-2). These characteristics are all consistent with the expected impact of circumnuclear starbursts on the observed properties of Seyfert 2's. Furthermore, they offer alternative empirical diagnostics of the presence of circumnuclear starbursts from a few easily measured quantities.},

@article{Lehnert:1996qy,
  abstract = {Supernova-driven galactic winds (superwinds) have been invoked to explain many aspects of galaxy formation and evolution. Such winds should arise when the supernova rate is high enough to create a cavity of very hot shock-heated gas within a galaxy. This gas can then expand outward as a high-speed wind that can accelerate and heat ambient interstellar or circum-galactic gas causing it to emit optical line radiation and/or thermal X-rays. Theory suggests that such winds should be common in starburst galaxies and that the nature of the winds should depend on the star formation rate and distribution. In order to systematize our observational understanding of superwinds (determine their incidence rate and the dependence of their properties on the star formation that drives them) and to make quantitative comparisons with the theory of superwinds, we have analyzed data from an optical spectroscopic and narrow-band imaging survey of an infrared flux-limited (S_60 microns_ >= 5.4 Jy) sample of about 50 IR-warm (S_60 microns_/S_100 microns_ > 0.4), starburst galaxies whose stellar disks are viewed nearly edge-on (b/a ~> 2). This sample contains galaxies with infrared luminosities from ~10^10^-10^12^ L_sun_ and allows us to determine the properties of superwinds over a wide range of star formation rates. We have found that extraplanar emission-line gas is a very common feature of these edge-on, IR-bright galaxies and the properties of the extended emission-line gas are qualitatively and quantitatively consistent with the superwind theory. We can summarize these properties as morphological, ionization, dynamical, and physical. 1. Morphological properties.-Extraplanar filamentary and shell-like emission-line morphologies on scales of hundreds of parsecs to 10 kpc are common, there is a general excess of line emission along the minor axis, the minor axis emission-line excess correlates with IR activity, and the minor axis emission-line excess also correlates with the relative compactness of the Halpha emission. 2. Ionization properties.-Line ratios become more shocklike (high ratios of [N II] lambda6583/Halpha, [S II] lambdalambda6716, 6731/Halpha, and [O I] lambda6300/Halpha) at more extreme IR properties, the most shocklike line ratios occur far out along the minor axis, shocklike line ratios corresponds to broad emission lines, and the most extreme line ratios correspond to the most extreme IR properties, especially for the emission-line gas farthest out along the minor axis. 3. Dynamical properties.-Lines are broader along the minor axis than along the major axis, line widths correlate with the IR activity, line widths correlate with line ratios, line widths do not correlate with rotation speed, minor axis shear (a measure of the systematic velocity change along the minor axis) correlates with IR activity, minor axis shear correlates with axial ratio and implies that a face-on galaxy would have an outflow/inflow speed of 170_-80_^+150^ km s^-1^, and the starbursts show statistically blueward line profile asymmetries. 4. Physical properties.-Pressures in the nuclei of these galaxies are 3 orders of magnitude higher than the ambient pressure in the interstellar medium of our galaxy, and the pressure falls systematically with radius. While none of these results are in themselves proof of the superwind model, we believe that when the results are taken as a whole, the superwind hypothesis is very successful in explaining what we have observed. In addition, these results have implications for galaxy evolution and the nature of the intergalactic medium. Those galaxies with the best evidence for driving superwinds are those with large IR luminosities (L_IR_ ~> 10^44^ ergs s^-1^), large IR excesses (L_IR_/L_OPT_ ~> 2), and warm far-IR colors (S_60 microns_/S_100 microns_ ~> 0.5). Integrating over the local far-IR luminosity function for galaxies meeting the above criteria, multiplying by the age of the universe, and then dividing by the local space density of galaxies implies that superwinds have carried out ~5 x 10^8^ M_sun_ in metals and 10^59^ ergs in kinetic plus thermal energy per average (Schecter L^*^) galaxy over the history of the universe. We note that these two quantities are approximately equal to the mass of metals contained inside an average galaxy and the gravitational binding energy of an average galaxy, respectively. Even with the conservative assumptions of this calculation (we have neglected that star formation rates were presumably higher in the early universe), it is obvious that superwinds may have a major impact on the evolution of individual galaxies and the intergalactic medium by injecting mass, metals, and kinetic energy into the galactic halo and potentially the intergalactic medium.},

@inproceedings{Heckman:2002fk,
  abstract = {In this contribution I summarize our current knowledge of the nature and significance of starburst-driven galactic winds (``superwinds''). Superwinds are complex multiphase outflows of cool, warm, and hot gas, dust, and magnetized relativistic plasma. The observational manifestations of superwinds result from the hydrodynamical interaction between the primary energy-carrying wind fluid and the ambient interstellar medium. Superwinds are ubiquitous in galaxies in which the global star-formation rate per unit area exceeds roughly 10$^{-1}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$. This criterion is met by local starbursts and the high-z Lyman Break galaxies. Several independent datasets and techniques imply that the total mass and energy outflow rates in a superwind are comparable to the starburst's star-formation-rate and mechanical energy injection rate, respectively. Outflow speeds in interstellar matter entrained in the wind range from $\sim 10^2$ to $10^3$ km/s, but the primary wind fluid itself may reach velocities as high as $\sim$3000 km s$^{-1}$. The available X-ray and far-UV ($FUSE$) data imply that radiative losses in superwinds are not significant. Superwinds may have established the mass-metallicity relation in ellipticals and bulges, polluted the present-day inter-galactic medium to a metallicity of $\sim$ 10 to 30% solar, heated the inter-galactic medium, and ejected enough dust into the inter-galactic medium to have potentially observable consequences.},

  abstract = {We analyze star-forming galaxies drawn from SDSS DR7 to show how the interstellar medium (ISM) Na I lambdalambda5890, 5896 (Na D) absorption lines depend on galaxy physical properties, and to look for evidence of galactic winds. We combine the spectra of galaxies with similar geometry/physical parameters to create composite spectra with signal-to-noise ~300. The stellar continuum is modeled using stellar population synthesis models, and the continuum-normalized spectrum is fit with two Na I absorption components. We find that (1) ISM Na D absorption lines with equivalent widths EW > 0.8 {\AA} are only prevalent in disk galaxies with specific properties---large extinction (AV ), high star formation rates (SFR), high SFR per unit area (SigmaSFR), or high stellar mass (M *); (2) the ISM Na D absorption lines can be separated into two components: a quiescent disk-like component at the galaxy systemic velocity and an outflow component; (3) the disk-like component is much stronger in the edge-on systems, and the outflow component covers a wide angle but is stronger within 60$\,^{\circ}$ of the disk rotation axis; (4) the EW and covering factor of the disk component correlate strongly with dust attenuation, highlighting the importance that dust shielding may play in the survival of Na I; (5) the EW of the outflow component depends primarily on SigmaSFR and secondarily on AV ; and (6) the outflow velocity varies from ~120 to 160 km s-1 but shows little hint of a correlation with galaxy physical properties over the modest dynamic range that our sample probes (1.2 dex in log SigmaSFR and 1 dex in log M *).},

  abstract = {We present an extension of the code ProDiMo that allows for a modeling of processes pertinent to active galactic nuclei and to an ambient chemistry that is time dependent. We present a proof-of-concept and focus on a few astrophysically relevant species, e.g., H+, H2+ and H3+; C+ and N+; C and O; CO and H2O; OH+, H2O+ and H3O+; HCN and HCO+. We find that the freeze-out of water is strongly suppressed and that this affects the bulk of the oxygen and carbon chemistry occurring in AGN. The commonly used AGN tracer HCN/HCO+ is strongly time-dependent, with ratios that vary over orders of magnitude for times longer than 10^4 years. Through ALMA observations this ratio can be used to probe how the narrow-line region evolves under large fluctuations in the SMBH accretion rate. Strong evolutionary trends, on time scales of 10^4-10^8 years, are also found in species such as H3O+, CO, and H2O. These reflect, respectively, time dependent effects in the ionization balance, the transient nature of the production of molecular gas, and the freeze-out/sublimation of water.},

  abstract = {Nuclear and starburst activity are known to often occur concomitantly. Herschel-SPIRE provides sampling of the far-infrared (FIR) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of type 1 and type 2 AGN, allowing for the separation between the hot dust (torus) and cold dust (starburst) emission. We study large samples of spectroscopically confirmed type 1 and type 2 AGN lying within the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) fields observed during the science demonstration phase, aiming to understand their FIR colour distributions and constrain their starburst contributions. We find that one third of the spectroscopically confirmed AGN in the HerMES fields have 5sigma detections at 250 mum, in agreement with previous (sub)mm AGN studies. Their combined Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-SPIRE colours (specifically S250/S70 vs S70/S24) quite clearly separate them from the non-AGN, star forming galaxy population, as their 24 mum flux is dominated by the hot torus emission. However, their SPIRE colours alone do not differ from those of non-AGN galaxies. SED fitting shows that all those AGN need a starburst component to fully account for their FIR emission. For objects at z > 2 we find a correlation between the infrared luminosity attributed to the starburst component, LSB, and the AGN accretion luminosity, Lacc, with LSB ∝ Lacc0.35. Type 2 AGN detected at 250 mum show on average higher LSB than type 1 objects but their number is still too low to establish whether this trend indicates stronger star formation activity.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

@article{Netzer:2009lr,
  abstract = {Accretion and star formation (SF) rates in low-redshift Sloan Digital Sky Survey type II active galactic nuclei (AGN) are critically evaluated. Comparison with photoionization models indicates that bolometric luminosity (Lbol) estimates based on L([OIII]lambda5007) severely underestimate Lbol in low-ionization sources such as LINERs. An alternative method based on L(Hbeta) is less sensitive to the ionization level, and a novel method, based on a combination of L([OIII]lambda5007) and L([OI]lambda6300), is perhaps the best. Using this method, I show that low-ionization AGN are accreting faster than assumed until now. Other significant related findings are as follows. (1) Any type II AGN property related to the black hole (BH) mass is more reliably obtained by removing blue galaxies from the sample. (2) Seyfert 2s and LINER 2s form a continuous sequence of L/LEdd with no indication for a change in accretion mechanism or mode of mass supply. There are very few, if any, LINERs in all type I samples which results in a much narrower L/LEdd distribution compared with type II samples. (3) There is a strong correlation between the SF luminosity, LSF, and Lbol over more than five orders of magnitude in luminosity. This leads to a simple relationship between bulge and BH growth rates, g(bulge)/g(BH) ~ L-0.2bol, where g(bulge)/g(BH) ~= 115 for Lbol = 1042 erg s-1. Seyfert 2s and LINER 2s follow the same LSF-Lbol correlation for all sources with a stellar age indicator, Dn4000, smaller than 1.8. This suggests that a similar fraction of SF gas finds its way to the centre in all AGN. (4) Lbol, LSF, L/LEdd and the specific SF rate follow Dn4000 in a similar way.},

@article{Magdis:2013rr,
  abstract = {We study the mid- to far-IR properties of a 24um-selected flux-limited sample (S24 > 5mJy) of 154 intermediate redshift (<z>~0.15), infrared luminous galaxies, drawn from the 5MUSES survey. By combining existing mid-IR spectroscopy and new Herschel SPIRE submm photometry from the HerMES program, we derived robust total infrared luminosity (LIR) and dust mass (Md) estimates and infered the relative contribution of the AGN to the infrared energy budget of the sources. We found that the total infrared emission of galaxies with weak 6.2um PAH emission (EW<0.2um) is dominated by AGN activity, while for galaxies with EW>0.2um more than 50% of the LIR arises from star formation. We also found that for galaxies detected in the 250-500um Herschel bands an AGN has a statistically insignificant effect on the temperature of the cold dust and the far-IR colours of the host galaxy, which are primarily shaped by star formation activity. For star-forming galaxies we reveal an anti-correlation between the LIR-to-rest-frame 8um luminosity ratio, IR8 = LIR\L8, and the strength of PAH features. We found that this anti-correlation is primarily driven by variations in the PAHs emission, and not by variations in the 5-15um mid-IR continuum emission. Using the [NeIII]/[NeII] line ratio as a tracer of the hardness of the radiation field, we confirm that galaxies with harder radiation fields tend to exhibit weaker PAH features, and found that they have higher IR8 values and higher dust-mass-weighted luminosities (LIR/Md), the latter being a proxy for the dust temperature (Td). We argue that these trends originate either from variations in the environment of the star-forming regions or are caused by variations in the age of the starburst. Finally, we provide scaling relations that will allow estimating LIR, based on single-band observations with the mid-infrared instrument, on board the upcoming JWST.},

@article{Peng:2002dq,
  abstract = {We present a two-dimensional fitting algorithm (GALFIT) designed to extract structural components from galaxy images, with emphasis on closely modeling light profiles of spatially well-resolved, nearby galaxies observed with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our algorithm improves on previous techniques in two areas: by being able to simultaneously fit a galaxy with an arbitrary number of components and with optimization in computation speed, suited for working on large galaxy images. We use two-dimensional models such as the ``Nuker'' law, the S{\'e}rsic (de Vaucouleurs) profile, an exponential disk, and Gaussian or Moffat functions. The azimuthal shapes are generalized ellipses that can fit disky and boxy components. Some potential applications of our program include: standard modeling of global galaxy profiles; extracting bars, stellar disks, double nuclei, and compact nuclear sources; and measuring absolute dust extinction or surface brightness fluctuations after removing the galaxy model. When examined in detail, we find that even simple looking galaxies generally require at least three components to be modeled accurately, rather than the one or two components more often employed. Many galaxies with complex isophotes, ellipticity changes, and position angle twists can be modeled accurately in two dimensions. We illustrate this by way of 11 case studies, which include regular and barred spiral galaxies, highly disky lenticular galaxies, and elliptical galaxies displaying various levels of complexities. A useful extension of this algorithm is to accurately extract nuclear point sources in galaxies. We compare two-dimensional and one-dimensional extraction techniques on simulated images of galaxies having nuclear slopes with different degrees of cuspiness, and we then illustrate the application of the program to several examples of nearby galaxies with weak nuclei. Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.},

@article{Newman:2012lq,
  abstract = {Using SINFONI Halpha, [N II], and [S II] AO data of 27 z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) from the SINS and zC-SINF surveys, we explore the dependence of outflow strength (via the broad flux fraction) on various galaxy parameters. For galaxies that have evidence for strong outflows, we find that the broad emission is spatially extended to at least the half-light radius (~a few kpc). Decomposition of the [S II] doublet into broad and narrow components suggests that this outflowing gas probably has a density of ~10-100 cm-3, less than that of the star-forming gas (600 cm-3). There is a strong correlation of the Halpha broad flux fraction with the star formation surface density of the galaxy, with an apparent threshold for strong outflows occurring at 1 M &sun; yr-1 kpc-2. Above this threshold, we find that SFGs with log m * > 10 have similar or perhaps greater wind mass-loading factors (eta = \dot{M}_out/SFR) and faster outflow velocities than lower mass SFGs, suggesting that the majority of outflowing gas at z ~ 2 may derive from high-mass SFGs. The mass-loading factor is also correlated with the star formation rate (SFR), galaxy size, and inclination, such that smaller, more star-forming, and face-on galaxies launch more powerful outflows. We propose that the observed threshold for strong outflows and the observed mass loading of these winds can be explained by a simple model wherein break-out of winds is governed by pressure balance in the disk.

  abstract = {We have studied the relationship between the high- and low-ionization [O IV] lambda25.89 mum, [Ne III] lambda15.56 mum, and [Ne II] lambda12.81 mum emission lines with the aim of constraining the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star formation contributions for a sample of 103 Seyfert galaxies. We use the [O IV] and [Ne II] emission as tracers for the AGN power and star formation to investigate the ionization state of the emission-line gas. We find that Seyfert 2 galaxies have, on average, lower [O IV]/[Ne II] ratios than Seyfert 1 galaxies. This result suggests two possible scenarios: (1) Seyfert 2 galaxies have intrinsically weaker AGNs, or (2) Seyfert 2 galaxies have relatively higher star formation rates than Seyfert 1 galaxies. We estimate the fraction of [Ne II] directly associated with the AGNs and find that Seyfert 2 galaxies have a larger contribution from star formation, by a factor of ~1.5 on average, than what is found in Seyfert 1 galaxies. Using the stellar component of [Ne II] as a tracer of the current star formation, we found similar star formation rates in Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 galaxies. We examined the mid- and far-infrared continua and found that [Ne II] is well correlated with the continuum luminosity at 60 mum and that both [Ne III] and [O IV] are better correlated with the 25 mum luminosities than with the continuum at longer wavelengths, suggesting that the mid-infrared continuum luminosity is dominated by the AGN, while the far-infrared luminosity is dominated by star formation. Overall, these results test the unified model of AGNs and suggest that the differences between Seyfert galaxies cannot be solely due to viewing angle dependence.},

  abstract = {We present the catalog of sources detected in the first 22 months of data from the hard X-ray survey (14-195 keV) conducted with the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) coded mask imager on the Swift satellite. The catalog contains 461 sources detected above the 4.8sigma level with BAT. High angular resolution X-ray data for every source from Swift-XRT or archival data have allowed associations to be made with known counterparts in other wavelength bands for over 97% of the detections, including the discovery of ~30 galaxies previously unknown as active galactic nuclei and several new Galactic sources. A total of 266 of the sources are associated with Seyfert galaxies (median redshift z ~ 0.03) or blazars, with the majority of the remaining sources associated with X-ray binaries in our Galaxy. This ongoing survey is the first uniform all-sky hard X-ray survey since HEAO-1 in 1977. Since the publication of the nine-month BAT survey we have increased the number of energy channels from four to eight and have substantially increased the number of sources with accurate average spectra. The BAT 22 month catalog is the product of the most sensitive all-sky survey in the hard X-ray band, with a detection sensitivity (4.8sigma) of 2.2 × 10-11 erg cm-2 s-1 (1 mCrab) over most of the sky in the 14-195 keV band.},

@article{Donoso:2013ve,
  abstract = {We calculate the angular correlation function for a sample of ~170,000 AGN extracted from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalog, selected to have red mid-IR colors W1-W2>0.8 and W2<15.05 (e.g., 4.6 um flux densities brighter than 0.14 mJy). The sample is expected to be >90% reliable at identifying AGN, and to have a mean redshift of <z>=1.1. In total, the angular clustering of WISE AGN is roughly similar to that of optical AGN, though we find that the AGN with the reddest mid-IR colors display a slightly higher clustering strength than the full AGN sample. We cross-match these objects with the photometric SDSS catalog and distinguish obscured sources with r-W2>6 from bluer, unobscured AGN. Obscured sources present a higher clustering signal than unobscured sources. By using relatively complete redshift distributions from the COSMOS survey, we find obscured sources at <z>~0.9 have a bias of b=2.9+-0.6 and are hosted in dark matter halos with a typical mass of log(M/M_sun h^{-1})~13.5. In contrast, unobscured AGN at <z>~1.1 have a bias b=1.6+-0.6 and inhabit halos of log(M/M_sun h^{-1})~12.4. These findings suggest that obscured AGN inhabit denser environments than unobscured AGN, and are difficult to reconcile with the simplest AGN unification models, such as obscuring torus models, where obscuration is driven solely by orientation.},

We briefly review the history of the different techniques for finding AGN and compare and contrast the advantages and difficulties of selection in different wavelength bands. We stress the strong selection effects in each wavelength band and the difficulty of defining complete samples. Of all the techniques presently used, we conclude that selection in the hard X-ray band via imaging and spectroscopy is the most complete and allows the best estimate of the number and evolution of active galaxies. However, all of the techniques have difficulties at low luminosities where emission due to stellar processes can have similar sizes and luminosities.},

@article{Alexander:2005ly,
  abstract = {The tight relationship between the masses of black holes and galaxy spheroids in nearby galaxies implies a causal connection between the growth of these two components. Optically luminous quasars host the most prodigious accreting black holes in the Universe, and can account for ≳30 per cent of the total cosmological black-hole growth. As typical quasars are not, however, undergoing intense star formation and already host massive black holes (> 108Msolar, where Msolar is the solar mass), there must have been an earlier pre-quasar phase when these black holes grew (mass range ~(106-108)Msolar). The likely signature of this earlier stage is simultaneous black-hole growth and star formation in distant (redshift z > 1; >8 billion light years away) luminous galaxies. Here we report ultra-deep X-ray observations of distant star-forming galaxies that are bright at submillimetre wavelengths. We find that the black holes in these galaxies are growing almost continuously throughout periods of intense star formation. This activity appears to be more tightly associated with these galaxies than any other coeval galaxy populations. We show that the black-hole growth from these galaxies is consistent with that expected for the pre-quasar phase.},

@article{Schweitzer:2006mz,
  abstract = {This paper addresses the origin of the far-infrared (FIR) continuum of QSOs, based on the Quasar and ULIRG Evolution Study (QUEST) of nearby QSOs and ULIRGs using observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope. For 27 Palomar-Green QSOs at z<~0.3, we derive luminosities of diagnostic lines ([Ne II] 12.8 mum, [Ne V] 14.3 mum, [O IV] 25.9 mum) and emission features (PAH 7.7 mum emission, which is related to star formation), as well as continuum luminosities over a range of mid- to far-infrared wavelengths between 6 and 60 mum. We detect star-formation-related PAH emission in 11/26 QSOs and fine-structure line emission in all of them, often in multiple lines. The detection of PAHs in the average spectrum of sources that lack individual PAH detections provides further evidence for the widespread presence of PAHs in QSOs. Similar PAH/FIR and [Ne II]/FIR ratios are found in QSOs and in starburst-dominated ULIRGs and lower luminosity starbursts. We conclude that the typical QSO in our sample has at least 30% but likely most of the far-infrared luminosity (~1010-1012 Lsolar) arising from star formation, with a tendency for larger star formation contribution at the largest FIR luminosities. In the QSO sample, we find correlations between most of the quantities studied including combinations of AGN tracers and starburst tracers. The common scaling of AGN and starburst luminosities (and fluxes) is evidence for a starburst-AGN connection in luminous AGN. Strong correlations of far-infrared continuum and starburst related quantities (PAH, low-excitation [Ne II]) offer additional support for the starburst origin of far-infrared emission.},

@article{Schawinski:2010zr,
  abstract = {We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and visual classifications of morphology from the Galaxy Zoo project to study black hole growth in the nearby universe (z < 0.05) and to break down the active galactic nucleus (AGN) host galaxy population by color, stellar mass, and morphology. We find that the black hole growth at luminosities L[O III] >1040 erg s-1 in early- and late-type galaxies is fundamentally different. AGN host galaxies as a population have a broad range of stellar masses (1010-1011 M sun), reside in the green valley of the color-mass diagram and their central black holes have median masses around 106.5 M sun. However, by comparing early- and late-type AGN host galaxies to their non-active counterparts, we find several key differences: in early-type galaxies, it is preferentially the galaxies with the least massive black holes that are growing, while in late-type galaxies, it is preferentially the most massive black holes that are growing. The duty cycle of AGNs in early-type galaxies is strongly peaked in the green valley below the low-mass end (1010 M sun) of the red sequence at stellar masses where there is a steady supply of blue cloud progenitors. The duty cycle of AGNs in late-type galaxies on the other hand peaks in massive (1011 M sun) green and red late-types which generally do not have a corresponding blue cloud population of similar mass. At high-Eddington ratios (L/L Edd>0.1), the only population with a substantial fraction of AGNs are the low-mass green valley early-type galaxies. Finally, the Milky Way likely resides in the sweet spot on the color-mass diagram where the AGN duty cycle of late-type galaxies is highest. We discuss the implications of these results for our understanding of the role of AGNs in the evolution of galaxies.  .},

  abstract = {According to unified schemes of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), the central engine is surrounded by dusty, optically thick clouds in a toroidal structure. We have recently developed a formalism that for the first time takes proper account of the clumpy nature of the AGN torus. We now provide a detailed report of our findings in a two-paper series. Here we present our general formalism for radiative transfer in clumpy media and construct its building blocks for the AGN problem-the source functions of individual dusty clouds heated by the AGN radiation field. We show that a fundamental difference from smooth density distributions is that in a clumpy medium, a large range of dust temperatures coexist at the same distance from the radiation central source. This distinct property explains the low dust temperatures found close to the nucleus of NGC 1068 in 10 mum interferometric observations. We find that, irrespective of the overall geometry, a clumpy dust distribution shows only moderate variation in its spectral energy distribution, and the 10 mum absorption feature is never deep. Furthermore, the X-ray attenuating column density is widely scattered around the column density that characterizes the IR emission. All of these properties are characteristic of AGN observations. The assembly of clouds into AGN tori and comparison with observations are presented in the companion paper.},

  abstract = {Unified schemes of active galactic nuclei require an obscuring dusty torus around the central source, giving rise to a Seyfert 1 line spectrum for pole-on viewing and Seyfert 2 characteristics in edge-on sources. Although the observed IR is in broad agreement with this scheme, the behavior of the 10 mum silicate feature and the width of the far-IR emission peak remained serious problems in all previous modeling efforts. We show that these problems find a natural explanation if the dust is contained in approximately five to 10 clouds along radial rays through the torus. The spectral energy distributions of both type 1 and type 2 sources are properly reproduced from different viewpoints of the same object if the optical depth of each cloud is >~60 at visual wavelengths and if the clouds' mean free path increases roughly in proportion to the radial distance.},

@article{Lira:2013rt,
  abstract = {We present results from model fitting to the spectral energy distribution (SED) of a homogeneous sample of Seyfert II galaxies drawn from the 12 mum Galaxy Sample. Imaging and nuclear flux measurements are presented in an accompanying paper. Here we add Spitzer/IRS observations to further constrain the SEDs after careful subtraction of a starburst component. We use the library of CLUMPY torus models from Nenkova et al. and also test the two-phase models recently produced by Stalevski et al. We find that photometric and spectroscopic observations in the mid-IR (lambda >~ 5 mum) are crucial to properly constrain the best-fit torus models. About half of our sources show clear near-IR excess of their SEDs above the best-fit models. This problem can be less severe when using the Stalevski et al. models. The nature of this emission is not clear since best-fitted blackbody temperatures are very high (~1700-2500 K) and the Type II classification of our sources would correspond to a small probability to peer directly into the hottest regions of the torus. Crucially, the derived torus parameters are quite robust when using CLUMPY models, independently of whether or not the sources require an additional blackbody component. Our findings suggest that tori are characterized by  {N}_0 ≳ 5, sigma >~ 40, tau <~ 25, ∠i >~ 40$\,^{\circ}$, Y <~ 50, and A los  v  ~ 100-300, where  {N}_0 is the number of clouds in the equatorial plane of the torus, sigma is the characteristic opening angle of the cloud distribution, tau is the opacity of a single cloud, ∠i is the line-of-sight orientation of the torus, Y is the ratio of the inner to the outer radii, and A los  v  is the total opacity along the line of sight. From these, we can determine typical torus sizes and masses of 0.1-5.0 pc and 104-106 M &sun;, respectively. We find tentative evidence that those nuclei with detected hidden broad-line regions are characterized by lower levels of extinction than those without one. Finally, we find no correlation between the torus properties and the presence of circumnuclear or more global star formation.},

@article{Schartmann:2008vn,
  abstract = {Context: Tori of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are made up of a mixture of hot and cold gas, as well as dust. In order to protect the dust grains from destruction by the surrounding hot gas as well as by the energetic (UV/optical) radiation from the accretion disk, the dust is often assumed to be distributed in clouds.  Aims: A new three-dimensional model of AGN dust tori is extensively investigated. The torus is modelled as a wedge-shaped disk within which dusty clouds are randomly distributed throughout the volume, by taking the dust density distribution of the corresponding continuous model into account. We especially concentrate on the differences between clumpy and continuous models in terms of the temperature distributions, the surface brightness distributions and interferometric visibilities, as well as spectral energy distributions.  Methods: Radiative transfer calculations with the help of the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code MC3D are used in order to simulate spectral energy distributions as well as surface brightness distributions at various wavelengths. In a second step, interferometric visibilities for various inclination as well as position angles and baselines are calculated, which can be used to directly compare our models to interferometric observations with the MIDI instrument.  Results: We find that the radial temperature distributions of clumpy models possess significantly enhanced scatter compared to the continuous cases. Even at large distances, clouds can be heated directly by the central accretion disk. The existence of the silicate 10 mum-feature in absorption or in emission depends sensitively on the distribution, the size and optical depth of clouds in the innermost part of the dust distribution. With this explanation, failure and success of previous modelling efforts of clumpy tori can be understood. The main reason for this outcome are shadowing effects of clouds within the central region. We underline this result with the help of several parameter variations. After adapting the parameters of our clumpy standard model to the circumstances of the Seyfert 2 Circinus galaxy, it can qualitatively explain recent mid-infrared interferometric observations performed with MIDI, as well as high resolution spectral data.},

@article{Fritz:2006yq,
  abstract = {We describe improved modelling of the emission by dust in a toroidal-like structure heated by a central illuminating source within active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We have chosen a simple but realistic torus geometry, a flared disc, and a dust grain distribution function including a full range of grain sizes. The optical depth within the torus is computed in detail taking into account the different sublimation temperatures of the silicate and graphite grains, which solves previously reported inconsistencies in the silicate emission feature in type 1 AGNs. We exploit this model to study the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 58 extragalactic (both type 1 and type 2) sources using archival optical and infrared data. We find that both AGN and starburst contributions are often required to reproduce the observed SEDs, although in a few cases they are very well fitted by a pure AGN component. The AGN contribution to the far-infrared luminosity is found to be higher in type 1 sources, with all the type 2 requiring a substantial contribution from a circumnuclear starburst. Our results appear in agreement with the AGN unified scheme, because the distributions of key parameters of the torus models turn out to be compatible for type 1 and type 2 AGNs. Further support to the unification concept comes from comparison with medium-resolution infrared spectra of type 1 AGNs by the Spitzer observatory, showing evidence for a moderate silicate emission around 10 mum, which our code reproduces. From our analysis we infer accretion flows in the inner nucleus of local AGNs characterized by high equatorial optical depths (AV~= 100), moderate sizes (Rmax < 100 pc) and very high covering factors (f~= 80 per cent) on average.},

@article{Gandhi:2009kx,
  abstract = {We present new photometry of 16 local Seyferts including 6 Compton-thick sources in N-band filters around 12-mum, obtained with the VISIR instrument on the 8-m Very Large Telescope. The near-diffraction-limited imaging provides the least-contaminated core fluxes for these sources to date. Augmenting these with our previous observations and with published intrinsic X-ray fluxes, we form a total sample of 42 sources for which we find a strong mid-infrared:X-ray (12.3 mum:2-10 keV) luminosity correlation. Performing a physically-motivated subselection of sources in which the Seyfert torus is likely to be best-resolved results in the correlation L_MIR ∝ L_X1.11$\pm$ 0.07, with a reduction of the scatter in luminosities as compared to the full sample. Consideration of systematics suggests a range of 1.02-1.21 for the correlation slope. The mean 2-keV:12.3-mum spectral index (alpha_IX) is found to be -1.10 $\pm$ 0.01, largely independent of luminosity. Indirectly-computed 12-mum bolometric corrections range over ≈10-30 if a known luminosity trend of X-ray bolometric corrections is assumed. Comparison with ISO data spanning a wider luminosity range suggests that our correlation can be extended into the quasar regime. That unobscured, obscured, and Compton-thick sources all closely follow the same luminosity correlation has important implications for the structures of Seyfert cores. The typical resolution-limit of our imaging corresponds to ~70 pc at a median z=0.01, and we use the tightness of the correlation to place constraints on the dominance of any residual emission sources within these physical scales. An upper-limit for any contaminating star formation of ≈40% of the unresolved flux is inferred, on average. We suggest that uncontaminated mid-IR continuum imaging of AGN is an accurate proxy for their intrinsic power.  Based on observations carried out in ESO programme 080.B-0860.},

  abstract = {We present an analysis of the mid-infrared (MIR) and optical properties of type 1 (broad-line) quasars detected by the Spitzer Space Telescope. The MIR color-redshift relation is characterized to z~3, with predictions to z=7. We demonstrate how combining MIR and optical colors can yield even more efficient selection of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) than MIR or optical colors alone. Composite spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are constructed for 259 quasars with both Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Spitzer photometry, supplemented by near-IR, GALEX, VLA, and ROSAT data, where available. We discuss how the spectral diversity of quasars influences the determination of bolometric luminosities and accretion rates; assuming the mean SED can lead to errors as large as 50% for individual quasars when inferring a bolometric luminosity from an optical luminosity. Finally, we show that careful consideration of the shape of the mean quasar SED and its redshift dependence leads to a lower estimate of the fraction of reddened/obscured AGNs missed by optical surveys as compared to estimates derived from a single mean MIR to optical flux ratio.},

@article{Elvis:1994uq,
  abstract = {We present an atlas of the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of normal, nonblazar, quasars over the whole available range (radio to 10 keV X-rays) of the electromagnetic spectrum. The primary (UVSX) sample includes 47 quasars for which the spectral energy distributions include X-ray spectral indices and UV data. Of these, 29 are radio quiet, and 18 are radio loud. The SEDs are presented both in figures and in tabular form, with additional tabular material published on CD-ROM. Previously unpublished observational data for a second set of quasars excluded from the primary sample are also tabulated. The effects of host galaxy starlight contamination and foreground extinction on the UVSX sample are considered and the sample is used to investigate the range of SED properties. Of course, the properties we derive are influenced strongly by the selection effects induced by quasar discovery techniques. We derive the mean energy distribution (MED) for radio-loud and radio-quiet objects and present the bolometric corrections derived from it. We note, however, that the dispersion about this mean is large (approximately one decade for both the infrared and ultraviolet components when the MED is normalized at the near-infrared inflection). At least part of the dispersion in the ultraviolet may be due to time variability, but this is unlikely to be important in the infrared. The existence of such a large dispersion indicates that the MED reflects only some of the properties of quasars and so should be used only with caution.},

@article{Honig:2013qy,
  abstract = {Dust around active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is distributed over a wide range of spatial scales and can be observed in the infrared (IR). It is generally assumed that the distribution on parsec scales forms a geometrically and optically thick entity in the equatorial plane around the accretion disk and broad-line region---dubbed dust torus---that emits the bulk of the subarcsecond-scale IR emission and gives rise to orientation-dependent obscuration. However, recent IR interferometry studies with unprecedented position angle (P.A.) and baseline coverage on these small scales in two obscured (type 2) AGNs have revealed that the majority of the mid-IR emission in these objects is elongated in the polar direction. These observations are difficult to reconcile with the standard interpretation that most of the parsec-scale mid-IR emission in AGNs originate from the torus and challenges the justification of using simple torus models to model the broadband IR emission. Here, we report detailed interferometry observations of the unobscured (type 1) AGN in NGC 3783 that allow us to constrain the size, elongation, and direction of the mid-IR emission with high accuracy. The mid-IR emission is characterized by a strong elongation toward position angle P.A. -52$\,^{\circ}$, closely aligned with the polar axis (P.A. -45$\,^{\circ}$). We determine half-light radii along the major and minor axes at 12.5 mum of (20.0 $\pm$ 3.0) mas × (6.7 $\pm$ 1.0) mas or (4.23 $\pm$ 0.63) pc × (1.42 $\pm$ 0.21) pc, which corresponds to intrinsically scaled sizes of (69.4 $\pm$ 10.8) r in × (23.3 $\pm$ 3.5) r in for the inner dust radius of r in = 0.061 pc as inferred from near-IR reverberation mapping. This implies an axis ratio of 3:1, with about 60%-90% of the 8-13 mum emission associated with the polar-elongated component. It is quite likely that the hot-dust emission as recently resolved by near-IR interferometry is misaligned with the mid-IR emitting source, which also finds a correspondence in the two distinct 3-5 mum and 20 mum bumps seen in the high angular resolution spectral energy distribution (SED). Based on this SED, we determine covering factors for the hot and warm dust components of C_{hot} = 0.42^{+0.42}_{-0.21} and C_{warm} = 0.92^{+0.92}_{-0.46}, respectively. We conclude that these observations support a scenario where the majority of the mid-IR emission in Seyfert AGNs originate from a dusty wind in the polar region of the AGN.},

  abstract = {We present deep Spitzer/Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra for complete samples of 46 2 Jy radio galaxies (0.05 < z < 0.7) and 19 3CRR FRII radio galaxies (z < 0.1), and use the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) features to examine the incidence of contemporaneous star formation and radio-loud active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. Our analysis reveals PAH features in only a minority (30%) of the objects with good IRS spectra. Using the wealth of complementary data available for the 2 Jy and 3CRR samples we make detailed comparisons between a range of star formation diagnostics: optical continuum spectroscopy, mid- to far-IR (MFIR) color, far-IR excess and PAH detection. There is good agreement between the various diagnostic techniques: most candidates identified to have star formation activity on the basis of PAH detection are also identified using at least two of the other techniques. We find that only 35% of the combined 2 Jy and 3CRR sample show evidence for recent star formation activity (RSFA) at optical and/or MFIR wavelengths. This result argues strongly against the idea of a close link between starburst and powerful radio-loud AGN activity, reinforcing the view that, although a large fraction of powerful radio galaxies may be triggered in galaxy interactions, only a minority are triggered at the peaks of star formation activity in major, gas-rich mergers. However, we find that compact radio sources (D < 15 kpc) show a significantly higher incidence of RSFA (>75%) than their more extended counterparts (≈15%-25%). We discuss this result in the context of a possible bias toward the selection of compact radio sources triggered in gas-rich environments.},

@article{Gehrels:2004qf,
  abstract = {The Swift mission, scheduled for launch in 2004, is a multiwavelength observatory for gamma-ray burst (GRB) astronomy. It is a first-of-its-kind autonomous rapid-slewing satellite for transient astronomy and pioneers the way for future rapid-reaction and multiwavelength missions. It will be far more powerful than any previous GRB mission, observing more than 100 bursts yr-1 and performing detailed X-ray and UV/optical afterglow observations spanning timescales from 1 minute to several days after the burst. The objectives are to (1) determine the origin of GRBs, (2) classify GRBs and search for new types, (3) study the interaction of the ultrarelativistic outflows of GRBs with their surrounding medium, and (4) use GRBs to study the early universe out to z>10. The mission is being developed by a NASA-led international collaboration. It will carry three instruments: a new-generation wide-field gamma-ray (15-150 keV) detector that will detect bursts, calculate 1'-4' positions, and trigger autonomous spacecraft slews; a narrow-field X-ray telescope that will give 5 positions and perform spectroscopy in the 0.2-10 keV band; and a narrow-field UV/optical telescope that will operate in the 170-600 nm band and provide 0.3 positions and optical finding charts. Redshift determinations will be made for most bursts. In addition to the primary GRB science, the mission will perform a hard X-ray survey to a sensitivity of ~1 mcrab (~2×10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1 in the 15-150 keV band), more than an order of magnitude better than HEAO 1 A-4. A flexible data and operations system will allow rapid follow-up observations of all types of high-energy transients, with rapid data downlink and uplink available through the NASA TDRSS system. Swift transient data will be rapidly distributed to the astronomical community, and all interested observers are encouraged to participate in follow-up measurements. A Guest Investigator program for the mission will provide funding for community involvement. Innovations from the Swift program applicable to the future include (1) a large-area gamma-ray detector using the new CdZnTe detectors, (2) an autonomous rapid-slewing spacecraft, (3) a multiwavelength payload combining optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray instruments, (4) an observing program coordinated with other ground-based and space-based observatories, and (5) immediate multiwavelength data flow to the community. The mission is currently funded for 2 yr of operations, and the spacecraft will have a lifetime to orbital decay of ~8 yr.},

  abstract = {he burst alert telescope (BAT) is one of three instruments on the Swift MIDEX spacecraft to study gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The BAT first detects the GRB and localizes the burst direction to an accuracy of 1 4 arcmin within 20 s after the start of the event. The GRB trigger initiates an autonomous spacecraft slew to point the two narrow field-of-view (FOV) instruments at the burst location within 20 70 s so to make follow-up X-ray and optical observations. The BAT is a wide-FOV, coded-aperture instrument with a CdZnTe detector plane. The detector plane is composed of 32,768 pieces of CdZnTe (4×4×2 mm), and the coded-aperture mask is composed of ˜52,000 pieces of lead (5×5×1 mm) with a 1-m separation between mask and detector plane. The BAT operates over the 15 150 keV energy range with ˜7 keV resolution, a sensitivity of ˜10-8 erg s-1 cm-2, and a 1.4 sr (half-coded) FOV. We expect to detect > 100 GRBs/year for a 2-year mission. The BAT also performs an all-sky hard X-ray survey with a sensitivity of ˜2 m Crab (systematic limit) and it serves as a hard X-ray transient monitor.},

@article{Netzer:2007ve,
  abstract = {This is the second paper studying the QSOs in the Spitzer QUEST sample. Previously we presented new PAH measurements and argued that most of the observed far-infrared (FIR) radiation is due to star-forming activity. Here we present spectral energy distributions (SEDs) by supplementing our data with optical, NIR, and FIR observations. We define two subgroups, of ``weak FIR'' and ``strong FIR'' QSOs, and a third group of FIR nondetections. Assuming a starburst origin for the FIR, we obtain ``intrinsic'' active galactic nucleus (AGN) SEDs by subtracting a starburst template from the mean SEDs. The resulting SEDs are remarkably similar for all groups. They show three distinct peaks corresponding to two silicate emission features and a 3 mum bump, which we interpret as the signature of the hottest AGN dust. They also display drops beyond ~20 mum that we interpret as the signature of the minimum temperature (~200 K) dust. This component must be optically thin to explain the silicate emission and the slope of the long-wavelength continuum. We discuss the merits of an alternative model in which most of the FIR emission is due to AGN heating. Such models are unlikely to explain the properties of our QSOs, but they cannot be ruled out for more luminous objects. We also find correlations between the luminosity at 5100 {\AA} and two infrared starburst indicators: L(60 mum) and L(PAH 7.7 mum). The correlation of L(5100 {\AA}) with L(60 mum) can be used to measure the relative growth rates and lifetimes of the black hole and the new stars.},

@article{Matsuta:2012gf,
  abstract = {We combine data from two all-sky surveys in order to study the connection between the infrared and hard X-ray (>10 keV) properties for local active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The Swift Burst Alert Telescope all-sky survey provides an unbiased, flux-limited selection of hard X-ray-detected AGNs. Cross-correlating the 22 month hard X-ray survey with the AKARI all-sky survey, we studied 158 AGNs detected by the AKARI instruments. We find a strong correlation for most AGNs between the infrared (9, 18, and 90 mum) and hard X-ray (14-195 keV) luminosities, and quantify the correlation for various subsamples of AGNs. Partial correlation analysis confirms the intrinsic correlation after removing the redshift contribution. The correlation for radio galaxies has a slope and normalization identical to that for Seyfert 1 galaxies, implying similar hard X-ray/infrared emission processes in both. In contrast, Compton-thick (CT) sources show a large deficit in the hard X-ray band, because high gas column densities diminish even their hard X-ray luminosities. We propose two photometric diagnostics for source classification: one is an X-ray luminosity versus infrared color diagram, in which type 1 radio-loud AGNs are well isolated from the others in the sample. The other uses the X-ray versus infrared color as a useful redshift-independent indicator for identifying CT AGNs. Importantly, CT AGNs and starburst galaxies in composite systems can also be differentiated in this plane based upon their hard X-ray fluxes and dust temperatures. This diagram may be useful as a new indicator to classify objects in new and upcoming surveys such as WISE and NuSTAR.},

@article{Hicks:2013ly,
  abstract = {In a matched sample of Seyfert and quiescent galaxies we simultaneously probe the stellar and molecular gas kinematics from 1 kpc down to 50 pc with the aim of identifying the dynamical processes dictating black hole accretion rates. This first paper compares the global characteristics of a sample of 10 galaxies. We find several differences within a radius of 500 pc that are correlated with active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity. The Seyferts have (1) a more centrally concentrated nuclear stellar surface brightness with lower stellar luminosities beyond a radius of 100 pc, (2) a lower stellar velocity dispersion within a radius of 200 pc, (3) elevated H2 1-0 S(1) luminosity out to a radius of at least 250 pc, and (4) more centrally concentrated H2 surface brightness profiles. These observed differences can be interpreted as evidence for Seyfert galaxies having a dynamically cold (in comparison to the bulge) nuclear structure composed of a significant gas reservoir and a relatively young stellar population. This structure is undetected (and possibly does not exist) in quiescent galaxies. The presence of such a nuclear structure in Seyfert galaxies provides evidence for inflow of the surrounding interstellar medium since the nuclear stellar population requires a supply of gas from which to form. The fueling of a Seyfert AGN is thus associated with the formation of a dynamically cold component of gas and stars on scales of hundreds of parsecs.  Based on observations at the ESO Very Large Telescope (083.B-0332).},

  abstract = {We have compiled a large sample of 151 high-redshift (z = 0.5-4) galaxies selected at 24 mum (S 24 > 100 muJy) in the GOODS-N and ECDFS fields for which we have deep Spitzer IRS spectroscopy, allowing us to decompose the mid-infrared spectrum into contributions from star formation and activity in the galactic nuclei. In addition, we have a wealth of photometric data from Spitzer IRAC/MIPS and Herschel PACS/SPIRE. We explore how effective different infrared color combinations are at separating our mid-IR spectroscopically determined active galactic nuclei from our star-forming galaxies. We look in depth at existing IRAC color diagnostics, and we explore new color-color diagnostics combining mid-IR, far-IR, and near-IR photometry, since these combinations provide the most detail about the shape of a source's IR spectrum. An added benefit of using a color that combines far-IR and mid-IR photometry is that it is indicative of the power source driving the IR luminosity. For our data set, the optimal color selections are S 250/S 24 versus S 8/S 3.6 and S 100/S 24 versus S 8/S 3.6; both diagnostics have ~10% contamination rate in the regions occupied primarily by star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei, respectively. Based on the low contamination rate, these two new IR color-color diagnostics are ideal for estimating both the mid-IR power source of a galaxy when spectroscopy is unavailable and the dominant power source contributing to the IR luminosity. In the absence of far-IR data, we present color diagnostics using the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer mid-IR bands which can efficiently select out high-z (z ~ 2) star-forming galaxies.},

  abstract = {We investigate the relationship between 8.44 GHz brightness temperatures and 1.4 to 8.44 GHz radio spectral indices with 6.2 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and 9.7 mum silicate absorption features for a sample of 36 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies. We find that galaxies having small 6.2 mum PAH equivalent widths (EQWs), which signal the presence of weak PAH emission and/or an excess of very hot dust, also have flat spectral indices. The three active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified through their excessively large 8.44 GHz brightness temperatures are also identified as AGN via their small 6.2 mum PAH EQWs. We also find that the flattening of the radio spectrum increases with increasing silicate optical depth, 8.44 GHz brightness temperature, and decreasing size of the radio source even after removing potential AGN, supporting the idea that compact starbursts show spectral flattening as the result of increased free-free absorption. These correlations additionally suggest that the dust obscuration in these galaxies must largely be coming from the vicinity of the compact starburst itself, and is not distributed throughout the (foreground) disk of the galaxy. Finally, we investigate the location of these infrared-bright systems relative to the main sequence (star formation rate versus stellar mass) of star-forming galaxies in the local universe. We find that the radio spectral indices of galaxies flatten with increasing distance above the main sequence, or in other words, with increasing specific star formation rate. This indicates that galaxies located above the main sequence, having high specific star formation rates, are typically compact starbursts hosting deeply embedded star formation that becomes more optically thick in the radio and infrared with increased distance above the main sequence.},

@article{Noeske:2007fr,
  abstract = {We analyze star formation (SF) as a function of stellar mass (M*) and redshift z in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey. For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 1010(1010.8) Msolar at z<0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFRs) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 mum photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct ``main sequence'' (MS), with a limited range of SFRs at a given M* and z (1 sigma<~+/-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to logM*. The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z>1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of the SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF and the effect of mergers on the SFR. Typical galaxies spend ~67%(95%) of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of <~2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z~1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFRs are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z~1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs SF prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

@article{Melendez:2010rt,
  abstract = {We have studied the relationship between the nuclear (high-resolution) radio emission, at 8.4GHz (3.6cm) and 1.4GHz (20cm), the [OIV] lambda25.89 mum, [NeIII] lambda15.56 mum and [NeII] lambda12.81 mum emission lines and the black hole mass accretion rate for a sample of Seyfert galaxies. In order to characterize the radio contribution for the Seyfert nuclei we used the 8.4GHz/[OIV] ratio, assuming that [OIV] scales with the luminosity of the active galactic nuclei (AGN). From this we find that Seyfert 1s (i.e. Seyfert 1.0s, 1.2s and 1.5s) and Seyfert 2s (i.e. Seyfert 1.8s, 1.9s and 2.0s) have similar radio contributions, relative to the AGN. On the other hand, sources in which the [NeII] emission is dominated either by the AGN or star formation have statistically different radio contributions, with star formation dominated sources more `radio loud', by a factor of ~2.8 on average, than AGN dominated sources. We show that star formation dominated sources with relatively larger radio contribution have smaller mass accretion rates. Overall, we suggest that 8.4GHz/[OIV], or alternatively, 1.4GHz/[OIV] ratios, can be used to characterize the radio contribution, relative to the AGN, without the limitation of previous methods that rely on optical observables.},

  abstract = {The KINGFISH project (Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: a Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel) is an imaging and spectroscopic survey of 61 nearby (d<30 Mpc) galaxies, chosen to cover a wide range of galaxy properties and local interstellar medium (ISM) environments found in the nearby universe. Its broad goals are to characterize the ISM of present-day galaxies, the heating and cooling of their gaseous and dust components, and to better understand the physical processes linking star formation and the ISM. KINGFISH is a direct descendant of the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), which produced complete Spitzer imaging and spectroscopic mapping and a comprehensive set of multiwavelength ancillary observations for the sample. The Herschel imaging consists of complete maps for the galaxies at 70, 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mum. The spectral line imaging of the principal atomic ISM cooling lines ([O I] 63 mum, [O III] 88 mum, [N II] 122,205 mum, and [C II] 158 mum) covers the subregions in the centers and disks that already have been mapped in the mid-infrared with Spitzer. The KINGFISH and SINGS multiwavelength data sets combined provide panchromatic mapping of the galaxies sufficient to resolve individual star-forming regions, and tracing the important heating and cooling channels of the ISM, across a wide range of local extragalactic ISM environments. This article summarizes the scientific strategy for KINGFISH, the properties of the galaxy sample, the observing strategy, and data processing and products. It also presents a combined Spitzer and Herschel image atlas for the KINGFISH galaxies, covering the wavelength range 3.6--500 mum. All imaging and spectroscopy data products will be released to the Herschel user-generated product archives.},

  abstract = {We present Spitzer photometric data for a complete sample of 19 low-redshift (z< 0.1) 3CRR radio galaxies as part of our efforts to understand the origin of the prodigious mid- to far-infrared (MFIR) emission from radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our results show a correlation between AGN power (indicated by [O III]lambda5007 emission line luminosity) and 24 mum luminosity. This result is consistent with the 24 mum thermal emission originating from warm dust heated directly by AGN illumination. Applying the same correlation test for 70 mum luminosity against [O III] luminosity we find this relation to suffer from increased scatter compared to that of 24 mum. In line with our results for the higher-radio-frequency-selected 2 Jy sample, we are able to show that much of this increased scatter is due to heating by starbursts that boost the far-infrared emission at 70 mum in a minority of objects (17%-35%). Overall this study supports previous work indicating AGN illumination as the dominant heating mechanism for MFIR emitting dust in the majority of low-to-intermediate redshift radio galaxies (0.03 < z < 0.7), with the advantage of strong statistical evidence. However, we find evidence that the low-redshift broad-line objects (z < 0.1) are distinct in terms of their positions on the MFIR versus [O III] correlations.},

@article{Gallimore:2010kx,
  abstract = {The mid-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 83 active galaxies, mostly Seyfert galaxies, selected from the extended 12 mum sample are presented. The data were collected using all three instruments, Infrared Array Camera (IRAC), Infrared Spectrograph (IRS), and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer (MIPS), aboard the Spitzer Space Telescope. The IRS data were obtained in spectral mapping mode, and the photometric data from IRAC and IRS were extracted from matched, 20'' diameter circular apertures. The MIPS data were obtained in SED mode, providing very low-resolution spectroscopy (R ~ 20) between ~55 and 90 mum in a larger, 20'' × 30'' synthetic aperture. We further present the data from a spectral decomposition of the SEDs, including equivalent widths and fluxes of key emission lines; silicate 10 mum and 18 mum emission and absorption strengths; IRAC magnitudes; and mid-far-infrared spectral indices. Finally, we examine the SEDs averaged within optical classifications of activity. We find that the infrared SEDs of Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s with hidden broad line regions (HBLRs, as revealed by spectropolarimetry or other technique) are qualitatively similar, except that Seyfert 1s show silicate emission and HBLR Seyfert 2s show silicate absorption. The infrared SEDs of other classes within the 12 mum sample, including Seyfert 1.8-1.9, non-HBLR Seyfert 2 (not yet shown to hide a type 1 nucleus), LINER, and H II galaxies, appear to be dominated by star formation, as evidenced by blue IRAC colors, strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, and strong far-infrared continuum emission, measured relative to mid-infrared continuum emission.},

@article{Pierce:2011uq,
  abstract = {Nuclear starbursts may contribute to the obscuration of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The predicted star formation rates (SFRs) are modest, and, for the obscured AGNs that form the X-ray background at z < 1, the associated faint radio emission lies just beyond the sensitivity limits of the deepest surveys. Here, we search for this level of star formation by studying a sample of 359 X-ray-selected AGNs at z < 1 from the Cosmic Evolution Survey field that are not detected by current radio surveys. The AGNs are separated into bins based on redshift, X-ray luminosity, obscuration, and mid-infrared characteristics. An estimate of the AGN contribution to the radio flux density is subtracted from each radio image, and the images are then stacked to uncover any residual faint radio flux density. All of the bins containing 24 mum detected AGNs are detected with a signal-to-noise >3sigma in the stacked radio images. In contrast, AGNs not detected at 24 mum are not detected in the resulting stacked radio images. This result provides strong evidence that the stacked radio signals are likely associated with star formation. The estimated SFRs derived from the radio stacks range from 3 M &sun; yr-1 to 29 M &sun; yr-1. Although it is not possible to associate the radio emission with a specific region of the host galaxies, these results are consistent with the predictions of nuclear starburst disks in AGN host galaxies.},

@article{Ballantyne:2008qy,
  abstract = {We assess the potential of nuclear starburst disks to obscure the Seyfert-like AGNs that dominate the hard X-ray background at z~1. Over 1200 starburst disk models, based on the theory developed by Thompson et al., are calculated for five input parameters: the black hole mass, the radial size of the starburst disk, the dust-to-gas ratio, the efficiency of angular momentum transport in the disk, and the gas fraction at the outer disk radius. We find that a large dust-to-gas ratio, a relatively small starburst disk, a significant gas mass fraction, and efficient angular momentum transport are all important to produce a starburst disk that can potentially obscure an AGN. The typical maximum star formation rate in the disks is ~10 Msolar yr-1. Assuming no mass loss due to outflows, the starburst disks feed gas onto the black hole at rates sufficient to produce hard X-ray luminosities of 1043-1044 erg s-1. The starburst disks themselves should be detectable at mid-infrared and radio wavelengths; at z=0.8, the predicted fluxes are ~1 mJy at 24 mum and ~10-30 muJy at 1.4 GHz. Thus, we predict a large fraction of radio/X-ray matches in future deep radio surveys. The starburst disks should be easily distinguished from AGNs in future 100 mum surveys by the Herschel Space Observatory with expected fluxes of ~5 mJy. Any AGN-obscuring starbursts will be associated with hot dust, independent of AGN heating, resulting in observable signatures for separating galactic and nuclear star formation. Finally, because of the competition between gas and star formation, nuclear starbursts will be associated with lower luminosity AGNs. Thus, this phenomenon is a natural explanation for the observed decrease in the fraction of obscured AGNs with luminosity.},

@article{Prieto:2010fk,
  abstract = {Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the central few tens of parsec region of some of the nearest, most well-studied, active galactic nuclei (AGN) are presented. These genuine AGN-core SEDs, mostly from Seyfert galaxies, are characterized by two main features: an infrared (IR) bump with the maximum in the 2-10mum range and an increasing X-ray spectrum with frequency in the 1 to ~200keV region. These dominant features are common to Seyfert type 1 and 2 objects alike. In detail, type 1 AGN are clearly distinguished from type 2 by their high spatial resolution SEDs: type 2 AGN exhibit a sharp drop shortwards of 2mum, with the optical to UV region being fully absorbed; type 1s instead show a gentle 2mum drop ensued by a secondary, partially absorbed optical to UV emission bump. On the assumption that the bulk of optical to UV photons generated in these AGN is reprocessed by dust and re-emitted in the IR in an isotropic manner, the IR bump luminosity represents >~70 per cent of the total energy output in these objects, and the second energetically important contribution is the high energies above 20keV.  Galaxies selected by their warm IR colours, i.e. presenting a relatively flat flux distribution in the 12-60mum range, have often being classified as AGN. The results from these high spatial resolution SEDs question this criterion as a general rule. It is found that the intrinsic shape of the infrared SED of an AGN and inferred bolometric luminosity largely depart from those derived from large aperture data. AGN luminosities can be overestimated by up to two orders of magnitude if relying on IR satellite data. We find these differences to be critical for AGN luminosities below or about 1044ergs-1. Above this limit, AGN tend to dominate the light of their host galaxy regardless of the integration aperture size used. Although the number of objects presented in this work is small, we tentatively mark this luminosity as a threshold to identify galaxy-light-dominated versus AGN-dominated objects.},

@article{Zubovas:2013lr,
  abstract = {Recent well resolved numerical simulations of AGN feedback have shown that its effects on the host galaxy may be not only negative but also positive. In the late gas poor phase, AGN feedback blows the gas away and terminates star formation. However, in the gas-rich phase(s), AGN outflows trigger star formation by over-compressing cold dense gas and thus provide positive feedback on their hosts. In this paper we study this AGN-triggered starburst effect. We show that star formation rate in the burst increases until the star formation feedback counteracts locally the AGN outflow compression. Globally, this predicts a strong nearly linear statistical correlation between the AGN and starburst bolometric luminosities in disc galaxies, L_* \propto L_{AGN}^{5/6}. The correlation is statistical only because AGN activity may fluctuate on short time scales (as short as tens of years), and because AGN may turn off but its effects on the host may continue to last until the AGN-driven outflow leaves the host, which may be up to 10 times longer than the duration of the AGN activity. The coefficient in front of this relation depends on the clumpiness and morphology of the cold gas in the galaxy. A maximum starburst takes place in am azimuthally uniform gas disc, for which we derive an upper limit of L_* \sim 50 times larger than L_{AGN} for typical quasars. For more clumpy and/or compact cold gas distributions, the starburst luminosity decreases. We also suggest that similar AGN-triggerred starbursts are possible in hosts of all geometries, including during galaxy mergers, provided the AGN is activated. Finally, we note that due to the short duration of the AGN activity phase the accelerating influence of AGN on starbursts may be much more common than observations of simultaneous AGN and starbursts would suggest.},

  abstract = {Pressure-regulated star formation is a simple variant on the usual supernova-regulated star formation efficiency that controls the global star formation rate as a function of cold gas content in star-forming galaxies, and accounts for the Schmidt-Kennicutt law in both nearby and distant galaxies. Inclusion of AGN-induced pressure, by jets and/or winds that flow back onto a gas-rich disk, can lead under some circumstances to significantly enhanced star formation rates, especially at high redshift and most likely followed by the more widely accepted phase of star formation quenching. Simple expressions are derived that relate supermassive black hole growth, star formation and outflow rates. The ratios of black hole to spheroid mass and of both black hole accretion and outflow rates to star formation rate are predicted as a function of time. I suggest various tests of the AGN-triggered star formation hypothesis.},

@article{Spinoglio:2002uq,
  abstract = {New far-infrared photometry with ISOPHOT aboard the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) is presented for 58 galaxies with homogeneous published data for another 32 galaxies, all belonging to the 12 mum galaxy sample-in total, 29 Seyfert 1 galaxies, 35 Seyfert 2 galaxies, and 12 starburst galaxies, or about half of the 12 mum active galaxy sample, plus 14 normal galaxies for comparison. ISO and Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) data are used to define color-color diagrams and spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Thermal dust emission at two temperatures (one cold at 15-30 K and one warm at 50-70 K) can fit the 60-200 mum SED, with a dust emissivity law proportional to the inverse square of the wavelength. Seyfert 1 galaxies and Seyfert 2 galaxies are indistinguishable longward of 100 mum, while, as already seen by IRAS, the former have flatter SEDs shortward of 60 mum. A mild anticorrelation is found between the [200-100] color and the ``60 mum excess.'' We infer that this is due to the fact that galaxies with a strong starburst component and thus a strong 60 mum flux have a steeper far-infrared turnover. In non-Seyfert galaxies, increasing the luminosity corresponds to increasing the star formation rate, which enhances the 25 and 60 mum emission. This shifts the peak emission from around 150 mum in the most quiescent spirals to shorter than 60 mum in the strongest starburst galaxies. To quantify these trends further, we identified with the IRAS colors three idealized infrared SEDs: pure quiescent disk emission, pure starburst emission, and pure Seyfert nucleus emission. Even between 100 and 200 mum, the quiescent disk emission remains much cooler than the starburst component. Seyfert galaxies have 100-200 mum SEDs ranging from pure disks to pure starbursts, with no apparent contribution from their active nuclei at those wavelengths. Based on observations with ISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

We detected luminous HCN(1-0) emissions toward a considerable fraction of these Seyfert galaxies (10 of 12 in our sub-sample), which indicated that some of these Seyfert galaxies, such as NGC 3079, NGC 3227, NGC 4051, NGC 6764, and NGC 7479, are indeed accompanied with compact nuclear starburst, given the tight correlation between the HCN(1-0) luminosity and the star formation rate among star-forming galaxies. However, we suggest that the elevated HCN(1-0) emission from some of these Seyfert galaxies, including NGC 1068, NGC 1097, NGC 5033, and NGC 5194, does not signify the presence of massive starbursts there. This is because these Seyfert nuclei show abnormally high HCN(1-0)/HCO^+(1-0) ratios (2-3), which were never observed in the starburst nuclei in our sample. This could be attributed to the overabundance of HCN molecules in the X-ray dominated regions (XDRs) at the centers of these Seyfert galaxies.},

@article{Leipski:2013fk,
  abstract = {We present Herschel far-infrared (FIR) photometry of eleven quasars at redshift z>5 that have previously been detected at 1.2mm. We perform full spectral energy distribution (SED) fits over the wavelength range lambda_rest ~0.1-400mu for those objects with good Herschel detections. These fits reveal the need for an additional far-infrared (FIR) component besides the emission from a dusty AGN-powered torus. This additional FIR component has temperatures of T_FIR ~ 40-60K with luminosities of L_(8-1000mu) ~ 10^13 L_sun (accounting for 25-60% of the bolometric FIR luminosity). If the FIR dust emission is due to star formation it would suggest star formation rates in excess of 1000 solar masses per year. We show that at long wavelengths (lambda_rest > 50mu) the contribution of the AGN-powered torus emission is negligible. This explains how previous FIR studies of high-redshift quasars that relied on single component fits to (ground-based) observations at lambda_obs > 350mu reached T_FIR and L_FIR values similar to our complete SED fits. Stacking the Herschel data of four individually undetected sources reveals a significant average signal in the PACS bands but not in SPIRE. The average SED of sources with individual Herschel detections shows a striking surplus in near- and mid-infrared emission when compared to common AGN templates. The comparison between two average SEDs (sources with and without individual Herschel detections) matched in the UV/optical indicates that for these objects the strength of the MIR emission may correlate with the strength of the FIR emission.},

@article{Sazonov:2012lr,
  abstract = {We estimate the relative contributions of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion disk, corona, and obscuring torus to the bolometric luminosity of Seyfert galaxies, using Spitzer mid-infrared (MIR) observations of a complete sample of 68 nearby active galactic nuclei (AGNs) from the INTEGRAL all-sky hard X-ray (HX) survey. This is the first HX-selected (above 15 keV) sample of AGNs with complementary high angular resolution, high signal-to-noise, MIR data. Correcting for the host galaxy contribution, we find a correlation between HX and MIR luminosities: L 15 mumvpropL0.74 $\pm$ 0.06 HX. Assuming that the observed MIR emission is radiation from an accretion disk reprocessed in a surrounding dusty torus that subtends a solid angle decreasing with increasing luminosity (as inferred from the declining fraction of obscured AGNs), the intrinsic disk luminosity, L Disk, is approximately proportional to the luminosity of the corona in the 2-300 keV energy band, L Corona, with the L Disk/L Corona ratio varying by a factor of 2.1 around a mean value of 1.6. This ratio is a factor of ~2 smaller than for typical quasars producing the cosmic X-ray background. Therefore, over three orders of magnitude in luminosity, HX radiation carries a large, and roughly comparable, fraction of the bolometric output of AGNs. We estimate the cumulative bolometric luminosity density of local AGNs at ~(1-3) × 1040 erg s-1 Mpc-3. Finally, the Compton temperature ranges between kT c ≈ 2 and ≈6 keV for nearby AGNs, compared to kT c ≈ 2 keV for typical quasars, confirming that radiative heating of interstellar gas can play an important role in regulating SMBH growth.},

@article{Mullaney:2012fk,
  abstract = {Using X-ray stacking analyses we estimate the average amounts of supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth taking place in star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1 and z ~ 2 as a function of galaxy stellar mass (M *). We find that the average SMBH growth rate follows remarkably similar trends with M * and redshift as the average star formation rates (SFRs) of their host galaxies (i.e., \dot{M}_BH vprop M * 0.86 $\pm$ 0.39 for the z ~ 1 sample and \dot{M}_BH vprop M * 1.05 $\pm$ 0.36 for the z ~ 2 sample). It follows that the ratio of SMBH growth rate to SFR is (1) flat with respect to M *, (2) not evolving with redshift, and (3) close to the ratio required to maintain/establish an SMBH to stellar mass ratio of ≈10-3 as also inferred from today's M BH-M Bulge relationship. We interpret this as evidence that SMBHs have, on average, grown in step with their host galaxies since at least z ~ 2, irrespective of host galaxy mass and active galactic nucleus triggering mechanism. As such, we suggest that the same secular processes that drive the bulk of star formation are also responsible for the majority of SMBH growth. From this, we speculate that it is the availability of gas reservoirs that regulate both cosmological SMBH growth and star formation.},

@article{Di-Matteo:2005lr,
  abstract = {In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies, have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100million years) and explains the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion.},

@article{Snyder:2012rt,
  abstract = {We analyze the link between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and mid-infrared flux using dust radiative transfer calculations of starbursts realized in hydrodynamical simulations. Focusing on the effects of galaxy dust, we evaluate diagnostics commonly used to disentangle AGN and star formation in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We examine these quantities as a function of time, viewing angle, dust model, AGN spectrum, and AGN strength in merger simulations representing two possible extremes of the ULIRG population: one is a typical gas-rich merger at z ~ 0, and the other is characteristic of extremely obscured starbursts at z ~ 2 to 4. This highly obscured burst begins star-formation-dominated with significant PAH emission, and ends with a ~10^9 yr period of red near-IR colors. At coalescence, when the AGN is most luminous, dust obscures the near-infrared AGN signature, reduces the relative emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and enhances the 9.7 micron absorption by silicate grains. Although generally consistent with previous interpretations, our results imply none of these indicators can unambiguously estimate the AGN luminosity fraction in all cases. Motivated by the simulations, we show that a combination of the extinction feature at 9.7 micron, the PAH strength, and a near-infrared slope can simultaneously constrain the AGN fraction and dust grain distribution for a wide range of obscuration. We find that this indicator, accessible to the James Webb Space Telescope, may estimate the AGN power as tightly as the hard X-ray flux alone, thereby providing a valuable future cross-check and constraint for large samples of distant ULIRGs.},

@article{Keating:2012yq,
  abstract = {An integral part of the unified model for active galactic nuclei (AGNs) is an axisymmetric obscuring medium, which is commonly depicted as a torus of gas and dust surrounding the central engine. However, a robust, dynamical model of the torus is required in order to understand the fundamental physics of AGNs and interpret their observational signatures. Here, we explore self-similar, dusty disk winds, driven by both magnetocentrifugal forces and radiation pressure, as an explanation for the torus. Using these models, we make predictions of AGN infrared (IR) spectral energy distributions from 2 to 100 mum by varying parameters such as the viewing angle (from i = 0$\,^{\circ}$ to 90$\,^{\circ}$), the base column density of the wind (from N H, 0 = 1023 to 1025 cm-2), the Eddington ratio (from L/L Edd = 0.01 to 0.1), the black hole mass (from M BH = 108 to 109 M &sun;), and the amount of power in the input spectrum emitted in the X-ray relative to that emitted in the UV/optical (from alphaox = 1.1 to 2.1). We find that models with N H, 0 = 1025 cm-2, L/L Edd = 0.1, and M BH >= 108 M &sun; are able to adequately approximate the general shape and amount of power expected in the IR as observed in a composite of optically luminous Sloan Digital Sky Survey quasars. The effect of varying the relative power coming out in X-rays relative to the UV is a change in the emission below ~5 mum from the hottest dust grains; this arises from the differing contributions to heating and acceleration of UV and X-ray photons. We see mass outflows ranging from ~1 to 4 M &sun; yr-1, terminal velocities ranging from ~1900 to 8000 km s-1, and kinetic luminosities ranging from ~1 × 1042 to 8 × 1043 erg s-1. Further development of this model holds promise for using specific features of observed IR spectra in AGNs to infer fundamental physical parameters of the systems.},

  abstract = {We analyze the evolution of 42 spiral galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey. We make use of ultraviolet (UV), optical, and near-infrared radial profiles, corrected for internal extinction using the total-infrared to UV ratio, to probe the emission of stellar populations of different ages as a function of galactocentric distance. We fit these radial profiles with models that describe the chemical and spectro-photometric evolution of spiral disks within a self-consistent framework. These backward evolutionary models successfully reproduce the multi-wavelength profiles of our galaxies, except for the UV profiles of some early-type disks for which the models seem to retain too much gas. From the model fitting we infer the maximum circular velocity of the rotation curve V C and the dimensionless spin parameter lambda. The values of V C are in good agreement with the velocities measured in H I rotation curves. Even though our sample is not volume limited, the resulting distribution of lambda is close to the lognormal function obtained in cosmological N-body simulations, peaking at lambda ~ 0.03 regardless of the total halo mass. We do not find any evident trend between lambda and Hubble type, besides an increase in the scatter for the latest types. According to the model, galaxies evolve along a roughly constant mass-size relation, increasing their scale lengths as they become more massive. The radial scale length of most disks in our sample seems to have increased at a rate of 0.05-0.06 kpc Gyr-1, although the same cannot be said of a volume-limited sample. In relative terms, the scale length has grown by 20%-25% since z = 1 and, unlike the former figure, we argue that this relative growth rate can be indeed representative of a complete galaxy sample.},

@article{Munoz-Mateos:2009fj,
  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the radial distribution of dust properties in the SINGS sample, performed on a set of ultraviolet (UV), infrared (IR), and H I surface brightness profiles, combined with published molecular gas profiles and metallicity gradients. The internal extinction, derived from the total-IR (TIR)-to-far-UV (FUV) luminosity ratio, decreases with radius, and is larger in Sb-Sbc galaxies. The TIR-to-FUV ratio correlates with the UV spectral slope beta, following a sequence shifted to redder UV colors with respect to that of starbursts. The star formation history (SFH) is identified as the main driver of this departure. Both L TIR/L FUV and beta correlate well with metallicity, especially in moderately face-on galaxies. The relation shifts to redder colors with increased scatter in more edge-on objects. By applying physical dust models to our radial spectral energy distributions, we have derived radial profiles of the total dust mass surface density, the fraction of the total dust mass contributed by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and the intensity of the radiation field heating the grains. The dust profiles are exponential, their radial scale length being constant from Sb to Sd galaxies (only ~10% larger than the stellar scale length). Many S0/a-Sab galaxies have central depressions in their dust radial distributions. The PAH abundance increases with metallicity for 12 + log(O/H) < 9, and at larger metallicities the trend flattens and even reverses, with the SFH being a plausible underlying driver for this behavior. The dust-to-gas ratio is also well correlated with metallicity and therefore decreases with galactocentric radius. Although most of the total emitted IR power (especially in the outer regions of disks) is contributed by dust grains heated by diffuse starlight with a similar intensity as the local Milky Way radiation field, a small amount of the dust mass (~1%) is required to be exposed to very intense starlight in order to reproduce the observed fluxes at 24 mum, accounting for ~10% of the total integrated IR power.},

  abstract = {We present ultraviolet through far-infrared (FIR) surface brightness profiles for the 75 galaxies in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS). The imagery used to measure the profiles includes Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV data, optical images from Kitt Peak National Observatory, Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory, and Sloan Digital Sky Survey, near-IR data from Two Micron All Sky Survey, and mid- and FIR images from Spitzer. Along with the radial profiles, we also provide multi-wavelength asymptotic magnitudes and several nonparametric indicators of galaxy morphology: the concentration index (C 42), the asymmetry (A), the Gini coefficient (G), and the normalized second-order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy's flux (\overline{M}_{20}). In this paper, the first of a series, we describe the technical aspects regarding the surface photometry, and present a basic analysis of the global and structural properties of the SINGS galaxies at different wavelengths. The homogeneity in the acquisition, reduction, and analysis of the results presented here makes these data ideal for multiple unanticipated studies on the radial distribution of the properties of stars, dust, and gas in galaxies. Our radial profiles show a wide range of morphologies and multiple components (bulges, exponential disks, inner and outer disk truncations, etc.) that vary not only from galaxy to galaxy but also with wavelength for a given object. In the optical and near-IR, the SINGS galaxies occupy the same regions in the C 42-A-G-\overline{M}_{20} parameter space as other normal galaxies in previous studies. However, they appear much less centrally concentrated, more asymmetric, and with larger values of G when viewed in the UV (due to star-forming clumps scattered across the disk) and in the mid-IR (due to the emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons at 8.0 mum and very hot dust at 24 mum). In an accompanying paper by Mu{\~n}oz-Mateos et al., we focus on the radial distribution of dust properties in the SINGS galaxies, providing a detailed analysis of the radial variation of the attenuation, the dust column density, the dust-to-gas ratio, the abundance of PAHs, and the intensity of the heating starlight.},

  abstract = {We present results from the deepest Herschel-PACS (Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer) far-infrared blank field extragalactic survey, obtained by combining observations of the GOODS (Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey) fields from the PACS Evolutionary Probe (PEP) and GOODS-Herschel key programs. We describe data reduction and the construction of images and catalogues. In the deepest parts of the GOODS-S field, the catalogues reach 3-sigma depths of 0.9, 0.6, 1.3 mJy at 70, 100, 160 um, respectively, and resolve ~75% of the cosmic infrared background at 100um and 160um into individually detected sources. We use these data to estimate the PACS confusion noises, to derive the PACS number counts down to unprecedented depths and to determine the infrared luminosity function of galaxies down to LIR=10^11 Lsun at z~1 and LIR=10^12 Lsun at z~2, respectively. For the infrared luminosity function of galaxies, our deep Herschel far-infrared observations are fundamental as they provide more accurate infrared luminosity estimates than those previously obtained from mid-infrared observations. Maps and source catalogues (>3-sigma) are now publicly released. Combined with the large wealth of multi-wavelength data available for the GOODS fields, these data provide a powerful new tool for studying galaxy evolution over a broad range of redshifts.},

@article{Kennedy:2012fj,
  abstract = {We present resolved Herschel images of circumbinary debris discs in the alpha CrB (HD 139006) and beta Tri (HD13161) systems. By modelling their structure, we find that both discs are consistent with being aligned with the binary orbital planes. Though secular perturbations from the binary can bring the disc into alignment, in both cases the alignment time at the distances at which the disc is resolved is greater than the stellar age, so we conclude that the coplanarity was primordial. Neither disc can be modelled as a narrow ring, requiring extended radial distributions. To satisfy both the Herschel and mid-infrared images of the alpha CrB disc, we construct a model that extends from 1 to 300 au, whose radial profile is broadly consistent with a picture where planetesimal collisions are excited by secular perturbations from the binary. However, this model is also consistent with stirring by other mechanisms, such as the formation of Pluto-sized objects. The beta Tri disc is modelled as a disc that extends from 50 to 400 au. A model with depleted (rather than empty) inner regions also reproduces the observations and is consistent with binary and other stirring mechanisms. As part of the modelling process, we find that the Herschel PACS (Photodetector and Array Camera & Spectrometer) beam varies by as much as 10 per cent at 70 mum and a few per cent at 100 mum. The 70 mum variation can therefore hinder image interpretation, particularly for poorly resolved objects. The number of systems in which circumbinary debris disc orientations have been compared with the binary plane is now 4. More systems are needed, but a picture in which discs around very close binaries (alpha CrB, beta Tri and HD 98800, with periods of a few weeks to a year) are aligned, and discs around wider binaries (99 Her, with a period of 50 yr) are misaligned, may be emerging. This picture is qualitatively consistent with the expectation that the protoplanetary discs from which the debris emerged are more likely to be aligned if their binaries have shorter periods.},

@article{Bonsor:2013uq,
  abstract = {We present Herschel spatially resolved images of the debris disc orbiting the subgiant Kappa CrB. Not only are these the first resolved images of a debris disc orbiting a subgiant, but Kappa CrB is a rare example of an intermediate mass star where a detailed study of the structure of the planetary system can be made, including both planets and planetesimal belt(s). The only way to discover planets around such stars using the radial velocity technique is to observe 'retired' A stars, which are cooler and slower rotators compared to their main-sequence counterparts. A planetary companion has already been detected orbiting the subgiant Kappa CrB, with revised parameters of m sin i = 2.1MJ and apl = 2.8AU (Johnson et al. 2008a). We present additional Keck I HIRES radial velocity measurements that provide evidence for a second planetary companion, alongside Keck II AO imaging that places an upper limit on the mass of this companion. Modelling of our Herschel images shows that the dust is broadly distributed, but cannot distinguish between a single wide belt (from 20 to 220AU) or two narrow dust belts (at around 40 and 165AU). Given the existence of a second planetary companion beyond approximately 3AU it is possible that the absence of dust within approximately 20AU is caused by dynamical depletion, although the observations are not inconsistent with depletion of these regions by collisional erosion, which occurs at higher rates closer to the star.},

By combining the Spitzer and SDSS data with the 2-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) we are able to construct a statistically robust rest-frame 0.1-100 micron type 1 quasar template. We find the quasar population is well-described by a single power-law SED at wavelengths less than 20 microns, in good agreement with previous work. However, at longer wavelengths we find a significant excess in infrared luminosity above an extrapolated power-law, along with signifiant object-to-object dispersion in the SED. The mean excess reaches a maximum of 0.8 dex at rest-frame wavelengths near 100 microns.},

@article{Rodriguez-Zaurin:2013lr,
  abstract = {We present an optical spectroscopic study of a 90% complete sample of 17 nearby ULIRGs with optical Seyfert nuclei, with the aim of investigating the nature of the nuclear warm gas outflows. A high proportion (94%) of our sample show disturbed emission line kinematics in the form of broad (FWHM > 500 km s-1) and/or strongly blueshifted (\Delta V < -150 km s-1) emission line components. This proportion is significantly higher than found in a comparison sample of non-Sy ULIRGs (19%). We also find evidence that the [OII]5007,4959 emission lines in Sy-ULIRGs are broader and more asymmetric that in samples of non-ULIRG Seyferts. The Sy-ULIRG sample encompasses a wide diversity of emission line profiles. In most individual objects we are able to fit the profiles of all the emission lines with a kinematic model derived from the strong [OIII]4959,5007 lines, using between 2 and 5 Gaussian components. From these fits we derive diagnostic line ratios that are used to investigate the ionization mechanisms for the different kinematic components. We show that, in general, the line ratios are consistent with gas of super-solar abundance photoionized by a combination of AGN and starburst activity, with an increasing contribution from the AGN with increasing FWHM of the individual kinematic components, and the AGN contribution dominating for the broadest components. However, shock ionization cannot be ruled out in some cases. Our derived upper limits on the mass outflows rates and kinetic powers of the emission line outflows show that they can be as energetically significant as the neutral and molecular outflows in ULIRGs-consistent with the requirements of the hydrodynamic simulations that include AGN feedback. However, the uncertainties are large, and more accurate estimates of the radii, densities and reddening of the outflows are required to put these results on a firmer footing.},

@article{Galametz:2013yq,
  abstract = {We present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integrated total infrared luminosities from Spitzer and Herschel bands used as monochromatic or combined tracers. We base our calibrations on resolved elements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 Mpc) observed with Herschel. We perform a resolved SED modelling of these objects using the Draine and Li (2007) dust models and investigate the influence of the addition of SPIRE measurements in the estimation of LTIR. We find that using data up to 250 um leads to local LTIR values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500 um) within 10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. We then study the distribution of energy in the resolved SEDs of our galaxies. The bulk of energy (30-50 per cent) is contained in the (70-160 um) band. The (24-70 um) fraction decreases with increasing metallicity. The (160-1100 um) submillimeter band can account for up to 25 per cent of the LTIR in metal-rich galaxies. We investigate the correlation between TIR surface brightnesses/luminosities and monochromatic Spitzer and Herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. The three PACS bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the LTIR, the 100 um band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. There is also a strong correlation between the SPIRE 250um and LTIR, although with more scatter than for the PACS relations. We also study the ability of our monochromatic relations to reproduce integrated LTIR of nearby galaxies as well as LTIR of z=1-3 sources. Finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used to derive TIR surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of Spitzer and Herschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.},

@article{Davies:2007kx,
  abstract = {We analyze star formation in the nuclei of nine Seyfert galaxies at spatial resolutions down to 0.085, corresponding to length scales of order 10 pc in most objects. Our data were taken mostly with the near-infrared adaptive optics integral field spectrograph SINFONI. The stellar light profiles typically have size scales of a few tens of parsecs. In two cases there is unambiguous kinematic evidence for stellar disks on these scales. In the nuclear regions there appear to have been recent, but no longer active, starbursts in the last 10-300 Myr. The stellar luminosity is less than a few percent of the AGN in the central 10 pc, whereas on kiloparsec scales the luminosities are comparable. The surface stellar luminosity density follows a similar trend in all the objects, increasing steadily at smaller radii up to ~1013 Lsolar kpc-2 in the central few parsecs, where the mass surface density exceeds 104 Msolar pc-2. The intense starbursts were probably Eddington limited and hence inevitably short lived, implying that the starbursts occur in multiple short bursts. The data hint at a delay of 50-100 Myr between the onset of star formation and subsequent fueling of the black hole. We discuss whether this may be a consequence of the role that stellar ejecta could play in fueling the black hole. While a significant mass is ejected by OB winds and supernovae, their high velocity means that very little of it can be accreted. On the other hand, winds from AGB stars ultimately dominate the total mass loss, and they can also be accreted very efficiently because of their slow speeds.  Based on observations at the European Southern Observatory VLT (60.A-9235, 070.B-0649, 070.B-0664, 074.B-9012, 076.B-0098).},

By focussing on a few specific topics, the aim is to highlight the different ways in which enhanced spatial resolution from AO can aid the scientific analysis of AGN data. After presenting some background about how AO works, I will describe a few recent observations made with AO of QSO host galaxies, the Galactic Center, and nearby AGN, and show how they have contributed to our knowledge of these enigmatic objects.},

@article{Friedrich:2010uq,
  abstract = {Aims: NGC 2992 is an intermediate Seyfert 1 galaxy showing outflows on kilo parsec scales which might be due either to AGN or starburst activity. We therefore aim at investigating its central region for a putative starburst in the past and its connection to the AGN and the outflows.  Methods: Observations were performed with the adaptive optics near infrared integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the VLT, complemented by longslit observations with ISAAC on the VLT, as well as N- and Q-band data from the Spitzer archive. The spatial and spectral resolutions of the SINFONI data are 50 pc and 83 km s-1, respectively. The field of view of 3 arcsec × 3 arcsec corresponds to 450 pc × 450 pc. Brgamma equivalent width and line fluxes from PAHs were compared to stellar population models to constrain the age of the putative recent star formation. A simple geometric model of two mutually inclined disks and an additional cone to describe an outflow was developed to explain the observed complex velocity field in H2 1-0S(1).  Results: The morphologies of the Brgamma and the stellar continuum are different suggesting that at least part of the Brgamma emission comes from the AGN. This is confirmed by PAH emission lines at 6.2 mum and 11.2 mum and the strength of the silicon absorption feature at 9.7 mum, which point to dominant AGN activity with a relatively minor starburst contribution. We find a starburst age of 40-50 Myr from Brgamma line diagnostics and the radio continuum; ongoing star formation can be excluded. Both the energetics and the timescales indicate that the outflows are driven by the AGN rather than the starburst. The complex velocity field observed in H2 1-0S(1) in the central 450 pc can be explained by the superposition of the galaxy rotation and an outflow.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, Chile (074.B-9012).},

@article{Dumas:2010qy,
  abstract = {We present the first spatially resolved spectroscopic imaging observations of the 12CO (1-0) line emission in the central 2.5 kpc of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4151, obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). Most of the cold molecular gas is distributed along two curved gas lanes about 1 kpc north and south of the active nucleus, coincident with the circumnuclear dust ring noted by previous authors. These CO arcs lie within the Inner Lindblad Resonance of the large scale oval bar and have kinematics consistent with those derived from neutral hydrogen observations of the disk and the bar. Two additional gas clumps are detected that show non-circular motion---one associated with the southern gas lane and the other lying ~600 pc north of the nucleus. Closer to the nucleus, no cold molecular gas is detected in the central 300 pc where abundant near-IR H2 line emission arises. This suggests that the H2 line emission is not a good indicator of a cold gas reservoir in NGC 4151 and that the H2 is likely photo-excited by the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The upper limit of the CO mass in the central 300 pc is sufficient to support the AGN activity at its current level for 107 yr. The total cold molecular mass detected by PdBI is 4.3 × 107 M sun. Finally, 3 mm continuum emission arising from the location of the AGN is detected with a flux of S 3 mm ~ 14 mJy and appears to be unresolved at an angular resolution of 2farcs8 (~180 pc).  Based on observations carried out with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).},

@article{Oi:2010fk,
  abstract = {We present near-infrared K- (1.9-2.5mum) and L- (2.8-4.2mum) band spectroscopy of 22 Seyfert nuclei. We used two methods to investigate the presence of nuclear starbursts: (1) the Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission feature at lambdarest = 3.3mum in the rest frame of the K-band spectrum (a starburst indicator) and (2) the CO absorption feature at lambdarest = 2.3-2.4mum in the rest frame of the K-band spectrum, originating in the CO molecule. We clearly detected the 3.3mum PAH emission features in five objects and the CO absorption features in 17 objects. Seyfert 2 galaxies tend to show bluer K - L colors compared with Seyfert 1 galaxies. We interpret the discrepancy as resulting from the relative strength of stellar emission because AGN emission is affected by dust extinction. The 3.3mum PAH emission luminosity (L3.3PAH) distributions for the Seyfert 1s and Seyfert 2s are very similar when normalized to the AGN power. The star-formation rates estimated from L3.3PAH could be large enough to inflate the dusty torus by a supernova explosion. We find that L3.3PAH positively correlates with the N-band luminosity with small aperture over a wide AGN luminosity range, and is independent of the physical area we probed. The results suggest that the nuclear region has a concentration of star formation and it would control the AGN activity.},

@article{Symeonidis:2013lr,
  abstract = {Using Herschel data from the deepest SPIRE and PACS surveys (HerMES and PEP) in COSMOS and GOODS (N+S), we examine the dust properties of IR-luminous (L_IR>10^10 L_sun) galaxies at 0.1<z<2 and determine how these evolve with cosmic time. The unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of survey selection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated, IR-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selection biases. We find that IR-luminous galaxies have SEDs with broad far-IR peaks characterised by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures in the 25-45K range. Hot (T>45K) SEDs and cold (T<25K), cirrus-dominated SEDs are rare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such as M82 and cool spirals such as M51. We observe a luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation, where the average dust temperature of log[L_IR/L_sun]=12.5 galaxies is about 10K higher than that of their log[L_IR/L_sun]=10.5 counterparts. However, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is the driving factor behind the L-T relation, the increase in dust mass and/or starburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. Our results show that the dust conditions in IR-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time: at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10K lower than what is measured locally. This is manifested as a flattening of the L-T relation, suggesting that (U)LIRGs in the early Universe are typically characterised by a more extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalent sources. Interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminosity dependent, with the fraction of LIRGs with T<35K showing a 2-fold increase from z~0 to z~2, whereas that of ULIRGs with T<35K shows a 6-fold increase.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effect of the high-pass filter data reduction technique on the Herschel PACS PSF and noise of the PACS maps at the 70, 100 and 160 um bands and in medium and fast scan speeds. This branch of the PACS Photometer pipeline is the most used for cosmological observations and for point-source observations.The calibration of the flux loss due to the median removal applied by the PACS pipeline (high-pass filter) is done via dedicated simulations obtained by polluting real PACS timelines with fake sources at different flux levels. The effect of the data reduction parameter settings on the final map noise is done by using selected observations of blank fields with high data redundancy. We show that the running median removal can cause significant flux losses at any flux level. We analyse the advantages and disadvantages of several masking strategies and suggest that a mask based on putting circular patches on prior positions is the best solution to reduce the amount of flux loss. We provide a calibration of the point-source flux loss for several masking strategies in a large range of data reduction parameters, and as a function of the source flux. We also show that, for stacking analysis, the impact of the high-pass filtering effect is to reduce significantly the clustering effect. The analysis of the global noise and noise components of the PACS maps shows that the dominant parameter in determining the final noise is the high-pass filter width. We also provide simple fitting functions to build the error map from the coverage map and to estimate the cross-correlation correction factor in a representative portion of the data reduction parameter space.},

  abstract = {During the first half of the universe's life, a heyday of star formation must have occurred because many massive galaxies are in place after that epoch in cosmic history. Our observations with the revolutionary Herschel Space Observatory reveal vigorous optically obscured star formation in the ultra-massive hosts of many powerful high-redshift 3C quasars and radio galaxies. This symbiotic occurrence of star formation and black hole driven activity is in marked contrast to recent results dealing with Herschel observations of X-ray-selected active galaxies. Three archetypal radio galaxies at redshifts 1.132, 1.575, and 2.474 are presented here, with inferred star formation rates of hundreds of solar masses per year. A series of spectacular coeval active galactic nucleus/starburst events may have formed these ultra-massive galaxies and their massive central black holes during their relatively short lifetimes.},

  abstract = {Scanamorphos is an IDL program to build maps from scan observations made with bolometer arrays. Scanamorphos can post-process scan observations performed with the Herschel photometer arrays. This post-processing mainly consists in subtracting the total low-frequency noise (both its thermal and non-thermal components), masking cosmic ray hit residuals, and projecting the data onto a map. Although it was developed for Herschel, it is also applicable with minimal adjustment to scan observations made with other bolometer arrays provided they entail sufficient redundancy; it was successfully applied to P-Artemis, an instrument operating on the APEX telescope. Scanamorphos does not assume any particular noise model and does not apply any Fourier-space filtering to the data. It is an empirical tool using only the redundancy built in the observations, taking advantage of the fact that each portion of the sky is sampled at multiple times by multiple bolometers. The user is allowed to optionally visualize and control results at each intermediate step, but the processing is fully automated.},

@article{Mendez:2013uq,
  abstract = {We present a study of Spitzer/IRAC and X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selection techniques in order to quantify the overlap, uniqueness, contamination, and completeness of each. We investigate how the overlap and possible contamination of the samples depends on the IR and X-ray depths. We use Spitzer/IRAC imaging, Chandra and XMM X-ray imaging, and PRism MUlti-object Survey (PRIMUS) spectroscopic redshifts to construct galaxy and AGN samples at 0.2<z<1.2 over 8 deg^2. We construct samples over a wide range of IRAC flux limits (SWIRE to GOODS depth) and X-ray flux limits (10 ks to 2 Ms). We compare IR-AGN samples defined using the IRAC color selection of Stern et al. and Donley et al. with X-ray detected AGN samples. For roughly similar depth IR and X-ray surveys, we find that ~75% of IR-AGN are identified as X-ray AGN. This fraction increases to ~90% when comparing against the deepest X-ray data, indicating that only ~10% of IR-selected AGN may be heavily obscured. The IR-AGN selection proposed by Stern et al. suffers from contamination by star-forming galaxies at various redshifts when using deeper IR data, though the selection technique works well for shallow IR data. While similar overall, the IR-AGN samples preferentially contain more luminous AGN, while the X-ray AGN samples preferentially contain lower specific accretion rate AGN, where the host galaxy light dominates at IR wavelengths. The host galaxy populations of the IR and X-ray AGN samples have similar restframe colors and stellar masses; both selections identify AGN in blue, star-forming and red, quiescent galaxies.},

@article{LaMassa:2013qy,
  abstract = {Using the spectra of a sample of $\sim$28,000 nearby obscured active galaxies from Data Release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we probe the connection between AGN activity and star formation over a range of radial scales in the host galaxy. We use the extinction-corrected luminosity of the [OIII] 5007 \AA\ line as a proxy of intrinsic AGN power and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rate. The star formation rates (SFRs) are taken from the MPA-JHU value-added catalog and are measured through the 3$^{\prime\prime}$ SDSS aperture. We construct matched samples of galaxies covering a range in redshifts. With increasing redshift, the projected aperture size encompasses increasing amounts of the host galaxy. This allows us to trace the radial distribution of star-formation as a function of AGN luminosity. We find that the star formation becomes more centrally concentrated with increasing AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio. This implies that such circumnuclear star formation is associated with AGN activity, and that it increasingly dominates over omnipresent disk star formation at higher AGN luminosities, placing critical constraints on theoretical models that link host galaxy star formation and SMBH fueling. We parametrize this relationship and find that the star formation on radial scales $<$1.7 kpc, when including a constant disk component, has a sub-linear dependence on SMBH accretion rate: $SFR \propto \dot{M}^{0.36}$, suggesting that angular momentum transfer through the disk limits accretion efficiency rather than the supply from stellar mass loss.},

@article{Casey:2013fk,
  abstract = {We present deep 450um and 850um observations of a large, uniformly covered 394arcmin^2 area in the COSMOS field obtained with the SCUBA-2 instrument (with RMS values 4.13mJy at 450um and 0.80mJy at 850um). This region of COSMOS is found to have a counts deficit at both wavelengths. Seventy-eight point sources are identified at 450um and 99 at 850um at >3.6sigma, with S_450=13-37mJy and S_850=2-16mJy. Approximately half of both samples are detected at both wavelengths. Since the positional uncertainties at 450um are small (1-2.5), this allows a precise identification of multiwavelength counterparts without reliance on detection at 24um or radio wavelengths; we find that only 40% of 450um-sources have 24um or radio counterparts and conclude that other submm work reliant on such counterparts could be significantly biased. The redshift distributions peak at <z>=2.0+-1.1 for 450um-selected galaxies and <z>=2.2+-1.6 for 850um-selected galaxies. The primary difference between 450 and 850um populations is their far-infrared S_850/S_450 colour, although this colour does not show any redshift evolution. All SCUBA-2 sources have UV/optical/near-infrared-derived star formation rates which underpredict their infrared-based SFR by factors ~>10; this has implications of how and if infrared-luminous systems sitting along the main sequence can be interpreted. The total contribution of these submillimeter sources (both 450um and 850um) to the cosmic star formation rate density is measured as roughly flat at ~0.01Msun/yr h^3 Mpc^-3 across 0<z<5; we end by discussing implications for future, deeper observations of short-wavelength single-dish bolometers.

@article{Melendez:2008lr,
  abstract = {We have studied the relationship between the [O IV] 25.89 mum emission-line luminosities, obtained from Spitzer spectra, the X-ray continua in the 2-10 keV band, primarily from ASCA, and the 14-195 keV band obtained with the SWIFT Burst Alert Telescope (BAT), for a sample of nearby (z<0.08) Seyfert galaxies. For comparison, we have examined the relationship between the [O III] lambda5007, the 2-10 keV, and the 14-195 keV luminosities for the same set of objects. We find that both the [O IV] and [O  III] luminosities are well correlated with the BAT luminosities. When comparing [O IV] and [O III] luminosities for the different types of galaxies, we find that the Seyfert 2s have significantly lower [O III] to [O IV] ratios than the Seyfert 1s. We suggest that this is due to more reddening of the narrow-line region (NLR) of the Seyfert 2s, since the [O IV] 25.89 mum emission line is much less affected by extinction. The combined effects of reddening and the X-ray absorption is the probable reason why the [O III] versus 2-10 keV correlation is better than the [O IV] versus 2-10 kev correlation. Based on photoionization models, we find that the [O IV] comes from higher ionization states and lower density regions than previous studies had determined for [O III]. Overall, we find the [O IV] to be an accurate indicator of the power of the AGN.},

  abstract = {We present spectroscopic results for all galaxies observed with the Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) that also have total infrared fluxes f IR measured with the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), also using AKARI photometry when available. Infrared luminosities and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from 8 mum to 160 mum are compared to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission from starburst galaxies or mid-infrared dust continuum from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at rest-frame wavelengths ~8 mum. A total of 301 spectra are analyzed for which IRS and IRAS include the same unresolved source, as measured by the ratio f nu(IRAS 25 mum)/f nu(IRS 25 mum). Sources have 0.004 < z < 0.34 and 42.5 < log L IR < 46.8 (erg s-1) and cover the full range of starburst galaxy and AGN classifications. Individual spectra are provided electronically, but averages and dispersions are presented. We find that log [L IR/nuL nu(7.7 mum)] = 0.74 $\pm$ 0.18 in starbursts, log [L IR/nuL nu(7.7 mum)] = 0.96 $\pm$ 0.26 in composite sources (starburst plus AGN), log [L IR/nuL nu(7.9 mum)] = 0.80 $\pm$ 0.25 in AGNs with silicate absorption, and that log [L IR/nuL nu(7.9 mum)] = 0.51 $\pm$ 0.21 in AGNs with silicate emission. L IR for the most luminous absorption and emission AGNs are similar and 2.5 times larger than for the most luminous starbursts. AGNs have systematically flatter SEDs than starbursts or composites, but their dispersion in SEDs overlaps starbursts. Sources with the strongest far-infrared luminosity from cool dust components are composite sources, indicating that these sources may contain the most obscured starbursts.},

@article{Choi:2011rt,
  abstract = {We investigate the active galactic nucleus (AGN) sub-population of a 24 mum flux-limited galaxy sample in the Spitzer Extragalactic First Look Survey. Using deep Keck optical spectroscopy and a series of emission-line diagnostics, we identify AGN-dominated systems over broad redshift 0 < z < 3.5 and luminosity 9 < log (L TIR) < 14 ranges, with sample means of langzrang = 0.85 and langlog (L TIR)rang = 11.5. We find that down to the flux limits of our Spitzer MIPS sample (f 24 > 200 muJy), 15%-20% of sources exhibit strong AGN signatures in their optical spectra. At this flux limit, the AGN population accounts for as much as 25%-30% of the integrated 24 mum flux. This corresponds to an MIR AGN contribution ≈2-3 × greater than that found in ISOCAM 15 mum studies that used X-ray AGN identifications. Based on our spectroscopically selected AGN sample, we also investigate the merits of Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) color selection for AGN identification. Our comparison reveals that although there is considerable overlap, a significant fraction of spectroscopic AGNs are not identifiable based on their MIR colors alone. Both the measured completeness and reliability of the IRAC color selections are found to be strongly dependent on the MIR flux limit. Finally, our spectroscopic AGN sample implies as much as a 3 × higher AGN surface density at high redshift (z > 1.2) than that of recent optical surveys at comparable optical flux limits, suggestive of a population of heavily obscured, optical/UV reddened AGNs.},

@article{Hony:2011vn,
  abstract = {Aims: We present an analysis of a galaxy (SAGE1CJ053634.78-722658.5) at a redshift of 0.14 of which the infrared (IR) emission is entirely dominated by emission associated with the active galactic nucleus.  Methods: We present the 5-37 mum Spitzer/IRS spectrum and broad wavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) of SAGE1CJ053634.78-722658.5, an IR point-source detected by Spitzer/SAGE. The source was observed in the SAGE-Spec program and was included to determine the nature of sources with deviant IR colours. The spectrum shows a redshifted (z = 0.14 $\pm$ 0.005) silicate emission feature with an exceptionally high feature-to-continuum ratio and weak polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission bands. We compare the source with models of emission from dusty tori around AGNs. We present a diagnostic diagram that will help to identify similar sources based on Spitzer/MIPS and Herschel/PACS photometry.  Results: The SED of SAGE1CJ053634.78-722658.5 is peculiar because it lacks far-IR emissiondue to cold dust and a clear stellar counterpart. We find that the SED and the IR spectrum can be understood as emission originating from the inner ~10 pc around an accreting black hole. There is no need to invoke emission from the host galaxy, either from the stars or from the interstellar medium, although a possible early-type host galaxy cannot be excluded based on the SED analysis. The hot dust around the accretion disk gives rise to a continuum, which peaks at 4 mum, whereas the strong silicate features may arise from optically thin emission of dusty clouds within ~10 pc around the black hole. The weak PAH emission does not appear to be linked to star formation, as star formation templates strongly over-predict the measured far-IR flux levels.  Conclusions: The SED of SAGE1CJ053634.78-722658.5 is rare in the local universe but may be more common in the more distant universe. The conspicuous absence of host-galaxy IR emission places limits on the far-IR emission arising from the dusty torus alone.  Based on observations obtained with Spitzer.},

@article{Dixon:2011yq,
  abstract = {We present observations of a sample of 28 luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) from the IRAS Bright Galaxy Catalog. These galaxies were previously observed by Goldader et al. using 2 mum spectroscopy on UKIRT. They found that stellar population synthesis models constrained by the spectroscopic diagnostics implied star formation rates that accounted for their infrared luminosities, and there was also no spectroscopic evidence for buried active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 2 mum. To search for evidence of AGNs buried deeply in extinction we have supplemented the UKIRT spectra with Spitzer mid-infrared (5.2-38.0 mum) spectra. Using a variety of spectroscopic diagnostics we find that ~50% of the sample shows some evidence for an AGN. We also find that the luminosity of about ~(17 $\pm$ 4)% of our sample is probably dominated by emission from AGNs, and the remaining ~(80 $\pm$ 4)% have luminosities dominated by starbursts. Since ~50% of the sample shows some evidence of concurrent AGN and starburst activities this suggests that both AGNs and starbursts commonly coexist in the LIRGs' phase of evolution. The sample consists of galaxies that show no AGN signatures at wavelengths less than 2 mum, so it appears that at wavelengths below 2 mum extinction in these galaxies masks the detection of AGNs in these and other LIRGs.},

  abstract = {We present a detailed investigation of the near-infrared to far-infrared (near-IR to far-IR) spectral energy distribution (SED) of a large sample of Spitzer-observed active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We fitted the spectra of 51 narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) and 64 broad-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (BLS1s) using a three-component model: a clumpy torus, a dusty narrow-line region and hot pure-graphite dust located in the outer part of the broad-line region (BLR). The fitting was performed on star formation (SF) subtracted SEDs using SF templates that take into account the entire range of possible host galaxy properties. We find that the mid-IR intrinsic emission of NLS1s and BLS1s is very similar, regardless of the AGN luminosity, with long-wavelength downturn at around 20-25 mum. We present a detailed model of the hot-dust component that takes into account the distribution of dust temperature within the clouds and their emission-line spectrum. The hot-dust continuum provides a very good fit to the observed near-IR continuum spectrum. Most line emission in this component is dramatically suppressed, except Mg II lambda2798 and He I lines that are still contributing significantly to the total BLR spectrum. We calculate the covering factors (CFs) of all the AGN components and show that the CF of the hot-dust clouds is about 0.15-0.35, similar to the CF of the torus, and is anticorrelated with the source luminosity and the normalized accretion rate.},

  abstract = {We have obtained high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging, nuclear spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and archival Spitzer spectra for 22 low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN; Lbol < 5 × 1042 erg s-1). Infrared (IR) observations may advance our understanding of the accretion ows in LLAGN, the fate of the obscuring torus at low accretion rates, and, perhaps, the star formation histories of these objects. However, while comprehensively studied in higher-luminosity Seyferts and quasars, the nuclear IR properties of LLAGN have not yet been well-determined. In these proceedings we summarise the results for the LLAGN at the relatively high-luminosity, high-Eddington ratio end of the sample. Strong, compact nuclear sources are visible in the MIR images of these objects, with luminosities consistent with or slightly in execss of that predicted by the standard MIR/X-ray relation. Their broadband nuclear SEDs are diverse; some resemble typical Seyfert nuclei, while others possess less of a well-defined MIR dust bump. Strong silicate emission is present in many of these objects. We speculate that this, together with high ratios of silicate strength to hydrogen column density, could suggest optically thin dust and low dust-to-gas ratios, in accordance with model predictions that LLAGN do not host a Seyfert-like obscuring torus.},

  abstract = {We present ground-based high-spatial resolution mid-infrared (MIR) observations of 20 nearby low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) with VLT/VISIR and the preliminary analysis of a new sample of 10 low-luminosity Seyferts observed with Gemini/Michelle. LLAGN are of great interest because these objects are the most common among active galaxies, especially in the nearby universe. Studying them in great detail makes it possible to investigate the AGN evolution over cosmic timescale. Indeed, many LLAGN likely represent the final stage of an AGN's lifetime. We show that even at low luminosities and accretion rates nuclear unresolved MIR emission is present in most objects. Compared to lower spatial resolution Spitzer/IRS spectra, the high-resolution MIR photometry exhibits significantly lower fluxes and different PAH emission feature properties in many cases. By using scaled Spitzer/IRS spectra of typical starburst galaxies, we show that the star formation contribution to the 12 mum emission is minor in the central parsecs of most LLAGN. Therefore, the observed MIR emission in the VISIR and Michelle data is most likely emitted by the AGN itself, which, for higher luminosity AGN, is interpreted as thermal emission from a dusty torus. Furthermore, the 12 /amemission of the LLAGN is strongly correlated with the absorption corrected 2-10 keV luminosity and the MIR- X-ray correlation found previously for AGN is extended to a range from 1040 to 1045 erg/s. This correlation is independent of the object type, and in particular the low-luminosity Seyferts observed with Michelle fall exactly on the power-law fit valid for brighter AGN. In addition, no dependency of the MIR-X-ray ratio on the accretion rate is found. These results are consistent with the unification model being applicable even in the probed low-luminosity regime.},

@article{Smith:2007lr,
  abstract = {We present a sample of low-resolution 5-38 mum Spitzer IRS spectra of the inner few square kiloparsecs of 59 nearby galaxies spanning a large range of star formation properties. A robust method for decomposing mid-infrared galaxy spectra is described and used to explore the behavior of PAH emission and the prevalence of silicate dust extinction. Evidence for silicate extinction is found in ~1/8 of the sample, at strengths that indicate that most normal galaxies undergo AV<~3 mag averaged over their centers. The contribution of PAH emission to the total infrared power is found to peak near 10% and extend up to ~20% and is suppressed at metallicities Z<~Zsolar/4, as well as in low-luminosity AGN environments. Strong interband PAH feature strength variations (2-5 times) are observed, with the presence of a weak AGN and, to a lesser degree, increasing metallicity shifting power to the longer wavelength bands. A peculiar PAH emission spectrum with markedly diminished 5-8 mum features arises among the sample solely in systems with relatively hard radiation fields harboring low-luminosity AGNs. The AGNs may modify the emitting grain distribution and provide the direct excitation source of the unusual PAH emission, which cautions against using absolute PAH strength to estimate star formation rates in systems harboring active nuclei. Alternatively, the low star formation intensity often associated with weak AGNs may affect the spectrum. The effect of variations in the mid-infrared spectrum on broadband infrared surveys is modeled and points to more than a factor of 2 uncertainty in results that assume a fixed PAH emission spectrum, for redshifts z=0-2.5.},

@article{Diamond-Stanic:2012rw,
  abstract = {We present estimates of black hole accretion rates (BHARs) and nuclear, extended, and total star formation rates for a complete sample of Seyfert galaxies. Using data from the Spitzer Space Telescope, we measure the active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity using the [O IV] lambda25.89 mum emission line and the star-forming luminosity using the 11.3 mum aromatic feature and extended 24 mum continuum emission. We find that black hole growth is strongly correlated with nuclear (r < 1 kpc) star formation, but only weakly correlated with extended (r > 1 kpc) star formation in the host galaxy. In particular, the nuclear star formation rate (SFR) traced by the 11.3 mum aromatic feature follows a relationship with the BHAR of the form SFR\propto \dot{M}_{BH}^{0.8}, with an observed scatter of 0.5 dex. This SFR-BHAR relationship persists when additional star formation in physically matched r = 1 kpc apertures is included, taking the form SFR\propto \dot{M}_{BH}^{0.6}. However, the relationship becomes almost indiscernible when total SFRs are considered. This suggests a physical connection between the gas on sub-kiloparsec and sub-parsec scales in local Seyfert galaxies that is not related to external processes in the host galaxy. It also suggests that the observed scaling between star formation and black hole growth for samples of AGNs will depend on whether the star formation is dominated by a nuclear or an extended component. We estimate the integrated black hole and bulge growth that occurs in these galaxies and find that an AGN duty cycle of 5%-10% would maintain the ratio between black hole and bulge masses seen in the local universe.},

Furthermore, we find an anti-correlation between the L(7.7 mum)/L(11.3 mum) ratio and the strength of the rotational H2 emission, which traces shocked gas. This suggests that shocks suppress the short-wavelength features by modifying the structure of the aromatic molecules or destroying the smallest grains. Most Seyfert nuclei fall on the relationship between aromatic emission and [Ne II] emission for star-forming galaxies, indicating that aromatic-based estimates of the star formation rate are generally reasonable in galaxies hosting active galactic nuclei. For the outliers from this relationship, which have small L(7.7 mum)/L(11.3 mum) ratios and strong H2 emission, the 11.3 mum feature still provides a valid measure of the star formation rate.},

@article{Vasudevan:2013dz,
  abstract = {We present a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of the non-beamed, hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the northern Galactic cap of the 58 month Swift Burst Alert Telescope (Swift/BAT) catalog, consisting of 100 AGNs with b > 50$\,^{\circ}$. This sky area has excellent potential for further dedicated study due to a wide range of multi-wavelength data that are already available, and we propose it as a low-redshift analog to the deep field observations of AGNs at higher redshifts (e.g., CDFN/S, COSMOS, Lockman Hole). We present distributions of luminosity, absorbing column density, and other key quantities for the catalog. We use a consistent approach to fit new and archival X-ray data gathered from XMM-Newton, Swift/XRT, ASCA, and Swift/BAT. We probe to deeper redshifts than the 9 month BAT catalog (langzrang = 0.043 compared to langzrang = 0.03 for the 9 month catalog), and uncover a broader absorbing column density distribution. The fraction of obscured (log N H >= 22) objects in the sample is ~60%, and 43%-56% of the sample exhibits complex 0.4-10 keV spectra. We present the properties of iron lines, soft excesses, and ionized absorbers for the subset of objects with sufficient signal-to-noise ratio. We reinforce previous determinations of the X-ray Baldwin (Iwasawa-Taniguchi) effect for iron Kalpha lines. We also identify two distinct populations of sources; one in which a soft excess is well-detected and another where the soft excess is undetected, suggesting that the process responsible for producing the soft excess is not at work in all AGNs. The fraction of Compton-thick sources (log N H > 24.15) in our sample is ~9%. We find that hidden/buried AGNs (which may have a geometrically thick torus or emaciated scattering regions) constitute ~14% of our sample, including seven objects previously not identified as hidden. Compton reflection is found to be important in a large fraction of our sample using joint XMM-Newton+BAT fits (langRrang = 2.7 $\pm$ 0.75), indicating light bending or extremely complex absorption. High-energy cutoffs generally lie outside the BAT band (E > 200 keV) but are seen in some sources. We present the average 1-10 keV spectrum for the sample, which reproduces the 1-10 keV X-ray background slope as found for the brighter 9 month BAT AGN sample. The 2-10 keV log(N)-log(S) plot implies completeness down to fluxes a factor of ~4 fainter than seen in the 9 month catalog. We emphasize the utility of this northern Galactic cap sample for a wide variety of future studies on AGNs.},

@article{Johnson:2013la,
  abstract = {We present a large-scale study of the X-ray properties and near-IR-to-radio SEDs of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) detected at 1.1mm with the AzTEC instrument across a ~1.2 square degree area of the sky. Combining deep 2-4 Ms Chandra data with Spitzer IRAC/MIPS and VLA data within the GOODS-N/S and COSMOS fields, we find evidence for AGN activity in ~14 percent of 271 AzTEC SMGs, ~28 percent considering only the two GOODS fields. Through X-ray spectral modeling and SED fitting using Monte Carlo Markov Chain techniques to Siebenmorgen et al. (2004) (AGN) and Efstathiou et al. (2000) (starburst) templates, we find that while star formation dominates the IR emission, with SFRs ~100-1000 M_sun/yr, the X-ray emission for most sources is almost exclusively from obscured AGNs, with column densities in excess of 10^23 cm^-2. Only for ~6 percent of our sources do we find an X-ray-derived SFR consistent with NIR-to-radio SED derived SFRs. Inclusion of the X-ray luminosities as a prior to the NIR-to-radio SED effectively sets the AGN luminosity and SFR, preventing significant contribution from the AGN template. Our SED modeling further shows that the AGN and starburst templates typically lack the required 1.1 mm emission necessary to match observations, arguing for an extended, cool dust component. The cross correlation function between the full samples of X-ray sources and SMGs in these fields does not indicate a strong correlation between the two populations at large scales, suggesting that SMGs and AGNs do not necessarily trace the same underlying large scale structure. Combined with the remaining X-ray-dim SMGs, this suggests that sub-mm bright sources may evolve along multiple tracks, with X-ray-detected SMGs representing transitionary objects between periods of high star formation and AGN activity while X-ray-faint SMGs represent a brief starburst phase of more normal galaxies.},

@article{de-Vries:2007fv,
  abstract = {We investigate faint radio emission from low- to high-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Their radio properties are inferred by co-adding large ensembles of radio image cut-outs from the FIRST survey, as almost all of the sources are individually undetected. We correlate the median radio flux densities against a range of other sample properties, including median values for redshift, [O III] luminosity, emission-line ratios, and the strength of the 4000 {\AA} break. We detect a strong trend for sources that are actively undergoing star formation to have excess radio emission beyond the ~1028 ergs s-1 Hz-1 level found for sources without any discernible star formation. Furthermore, this additional radio emission correlates well with the strength of the 4000 {\AA} break in the optical spectrum, and may be used to assess the age of the star-forming component. We examine two subsamples, one containing the systems with emission-line ratios most like star-forming systems, and one with the sources that have characteristic AGN ratios. This division also separates the mechanism responsible for the radio emission (star formation vs. AGNs). For both cases we find a strong, almost identical correlation between [O III] and radio luminosity, with the AGN sample extending toward lower, and the star formation sample toward higher luminosities. A clearer separation between the two subsamples is seen as function of the central velocity dispersion sigma of the host galaxy. For systems at similar redshifts and values of sigma, the star formation subsample is brighter than the AGN in the radio by an order of magnitude. This underlines the notion that the radio emission in star-forming systems can dominate the emission associated with the AGN.},

  abstract = {In order to understand the mutual influence between active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star formation during the evolution of galaxies, we investigate 142 galaxies detected in both X-ray and 70{\mu}m observations in the COSMOS (Cosmic Evolution Survey) field. All of our data are obtained from archive, X-ray point source catalogs from Chandra and XMM-Newton observation; far-infrared 70{\mu}m point source catalog from Spitzer-MIPS observation. Although the IRAC colors of our samples indicate the existence of star formation, the ratio of rest frame 2-10 keV luminosity to total infrared luminosity (8-1000{\mu}m) shows that AGN predominates the spectral energy distribution (SED). We identify obscured AGN in these 70{\mu}m luminous galaxies as characterized by a larger hardness ratio. The higher X-ray obscuration fraction indicates an extra contribution from the star formation in the host galaxy in addition to the usual AGN dusty torus. If AGN feedback occurs in their host galaxies, the star formation must be quenched and dust in host galaxy will be dispersed. However, our temperature fitting shows there is no significant dust temperature enhancement in far-infrared wavelength, suggesting the thermal radiative feedback is absent from the AGN to the galaxy.},

  abstract = {We present results of the 2.5-5 {\mu}m spectroscopy of a sample of hard X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using the grism mode of the InfraRed Camera (IRC) on board the infrared astronomical satellite AKARI. The sample is selected from the 9-month Swift/BAT survey in the 14-195 keV band, which provides a fair sample of AGNs including highly absorbed ones. The 2.5-5 {\mu}m spectroscopy provide a strong diagnostic tool for the circumnuclear environment of AGNs through the continuum shapes and emission/absorption features such as the 3.3 {\mu}m polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and the broad 3.1 {\mu}m H2O ice, 3.4 {\mu}m bare carbonaceous dust, 4.26 {\mu}m CO2 and 4.67 {\mu}m CO absorptions. As our first step, we use the 3.3 {\mu}m PAH emission as a proxy for the star-formation activity and searched for possible difference of star-formation activity between type 1 (unabsorbed) and type 2 (absorbed) AGNs. We found no significant dependence of the 3.3 {\mu}m PAH line luminosity, normalized by the black hole mass, on optical AGNs types or the X-ray measured column densities.},

@article{Davies:2012th,
  abstract = {While the existence of a starburst-AGN connection is undisputed, there is no consensus on what the connection is. In this contribution, we begin by noting that the mechanisms which drive gas inwards in disk galaxies are generally inefficient at removing angular momentum, leading to stalled inflows. Thus, a tiered series of such processes is required to bring gas to the smallest scales, each of which on its own may not correlate with the presence of an AGN. Similarly, each may be associated with a starburst event, making it important to discriminate between 'circumnuclear' and 'nuclear' star formation. In this contribution, we show that stellar feedback on scales of tens of parsecs plays a critical role in first hindering and then helping accretion. We argue that it is only after the initial turbulent phases of a starburst that gas from slow stellar winds can accrete efficiently to smaller scales. This would imply that the properties of the obscuring torus are directly coupled to star formation and that the torus must be a complex dynamical entity. We finish by remarking on other contexts where similar processes appear to be at work.},

@article{Thean:2001ij,
  abstract = {We discuss the properties of compact nuclear radio components in Seyfert galaxies from the extended 12-mum AGN sample of Rush et al. Our main results can be summarized as follows. Type 1 and type 2 Seyferts produce compact radio components which are indistinguishable in strength and aspect, indicating that their central engines are alike, as proposed by the unification model. Infrared IRAS fluxes are more closely correlated with low-resolution radio fluxes than high-resolution radio fluxes, suggesting that they are dominated by kiloparsec-scale, extranuclear emission regions; extranuclear emission may be stronger in type 2 Seyferts. Early-type Seyfert galaxies tend to have stronger nuclear radio emission than late-type Seyfert galaxies. V-shaped extended emission-line regions, indicative of `ionization cones', are usually found in sources with large, collimated radio outflows. Hidden broad lines are most likely to be found in sources with powerful nuclear radio sources. Type 1 and type 2 Seyferts selected by their IRAS 12-mum flux densities have well-matched properties.},

@article{Alonso-Herrero:2001sp,
  abstract = {JHKL'M (1-5 mum) imaging of a sample of Seyfert 2 galaxies is presented. We have performed an accurate estimate of the near-infrared nonstellar nuclear fluxes. We confirm that the near-infrared nuclear continuum between 1 and 2.2 mum of some Seyfert 2s is dominated by stellar emission, whereas the continuum emission at longer wavelengths (lambda=3-5 mum) is almost entirely nonstellar in origin. The nonstellar spectral energy distributions (SED) in the infrared (up to 15 mum) of Seyfert galaxies show a variety of shapes, and they are well reproduced with the tapered disk models of Efstathiou & Rowan-Robinson. We have used two models, one including an optically thin cone component found to fit the SED of NGC 1068 and a coneless model. Although our modeling of the SEDs does not allow us to favor either model to account for all the observed SEDs, we find that the viewing angle toward the central source is well constrained by both models. The galaxies in our sample have fitted values of the viewing angle in the range thetav=0$\,^{\circ}$-64$\,^{\circ}$, for the assumed model parameters. We have also investigated nonstellar color-color diagrams (L'-M vs. H-M and L'-M vs. H-L'). The colors of the Seyfert galaxies with viewing angles thetav<30$\,^{\circ}$ are better reproduced with the cone model. These diagrams provide a good means to separate Seyfert 2s with moderate obscuration (AV<~20 mag from hard X-ray observations) from those with high obscuration. The ground-based 4.8 mum and ISO 9.6 mum luminosities are well correlated with the hard X-ray luminosities of Seyfert 1s and 2s. These continuum emissions appear as a good indicator of the AGN luminosity, at least in the cases of hard X-ray Compton-thin Seyfert galaxies (NH<=1024 cm-2). We finally stress the finding that some Compton thick galaxies show bright nonstellar emission at 5 mum. This suggests that the near-infrared emission in Seyfert galaxies is produced in an extended component illuminated by the central source, that is more visible from all viewing angles, providing a good explanation for the differing NH/AV ratios found in some Seyfert 2s. We discuss possible implications of mid-infrared surveys for the search of counterparts of highly obscured hard X-ray sources. This work is based on observations collected at UKIRT.

@article{Alonso-Herrero:2003hc,
  abstract = {We present nuclear spectral energy distributions (SEDs) in the range 0.4-16 mum for an expanded CfA sample of Seyfert galaxies. The spectral indexes (fnu~nu-alphaIR) from 1 to 16 mum range from alphaIR~0.9 to 3.8. The shapes of the spectra are correlated with Seyfert type in the sense that steeper nuclear SEDs (nufnu increasing with increasing wavelength) tend to be found in Seyfert 2's, and flatter SEDs (nufnu is constant) in Seyfert 1-1.5's. The galaxies optically classified as Seyferts 1.8's and 1.9's display values of alphaIR as in type 1 objects, or values intermediate between those of Seyfert 1's and Seyfert 2's. The intermediate SEDs of many Seyfert 1.8-1.9's may be consistent with the presence of a pure Seyfert 1 viewed through a moderate amount (AV<~5 mag) of foreground galaxy extinction. We find, however, that between 10% and 20% of galaxies with broad optical line components have steep infrared SEDs. Torus models usually adopt high equatorial opacities to reproduce the infrared properties of Seyfert 1's and 2's, resulting in a dichotomy of infrared SEDs (flat for type 1's, and steep for type 2's). Such a dichotomy, however, is not observed in our sample. The wide range of spectral indexes observed in the type 2 objects, the lack of extremely steep SEDs, and the large numbers of objects with intermediate spectral indexes cannot be reconciled with predictions from existing optically thick torus models. We discuss possible modifications to improve torus models, including low optical depth tori, clumpy dusty tori, and high optical depth tori with an extended optically thin component.

@article{Fabian:2012dp,
  abstract = {Radiation, winds, and jets from the active nucleus of a massive galaxy can interact with its interstellar medium, and this can lead to ejection or heating of the gas. This terminates star formation in the galaxy and stifles accretion onto the black hole. Such active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback can account for the observed proportionality between the central black hole and the host galaxy mass. Direct observational evidence for the radiative or quasar mode of feedback, which occurs when AGN are very luminous, has been difficult to obtain but is accumulating from a few exceptional objects. Feedback from the kinetic or radio mode, which uses the mechanical energy of radio-emitting jets often seen when AGN are operating at a lower level, is common in massive elliptical galaxies. This mode is well observed directly through X-ray observations of the central galaxies of cool core clusters in the form of bubbles in the hot surrounding medium. The energy flow, which is roughly continuous, heats the hot intracluster gas and reduces radiative cooling and subsequent star formation by an order of magnitude. Feedback appears to maintain a long-lived heating/cooling balance. Powerful, jetted radio outbursts may represent a further mode of energy feedback that affects the cores of groups and subclusters. New telescopes and instruments from the radio to X-ray bands will come into operation over the next several years and lead to a rapid expansion in observational data on all modes of AGN feedback.},

  abstract = {We study the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) bands, ionic emission lines, and mid-infrared continuum properties in a sample of 171 emission line galaxies taken from the literature plus 15 new active galactic nucleus (AGN) Spitzer spectra. We normalize the spectra at lambda = 23 mum and grouped them according to the type of nuclear activity. The continuum shape steeply rises for longer wavelengths and can be fitted with a warm blackbody distribution of T ~ 150-300 K. The brightest PAH spectral bands (6.2, 7.7, 8.6, 11.3, and 12.7 mum) and the forbidden emission lines of [Si II] 34.8 mum, [Ar II] 6.9 mum, [S III] 18.7 and 33.4 mum were detected in all the starbursts and in ~80% of the Seyfert 2. Taking under consideration only the PAH bands at 7.7 mum, 11.3 mum, and 12.7 mum, we find that they are present in ~80% of the Seyfert 1, while only half of this type of activity show the 6.2 mum and 8.6 mum PAH bands. The observed intensity ratios for neutral and ionized PAHs (6.2 mum/7.7 mum × 11.3 mum/7.7 mum) were compared to theoretical intensity ratios, showing that AGNs have higher ionization fraction and larger PAH molecules (>=180 carbon atoms) than SB galaxies. The ratio between the ionized (7.7 mum) and the neutral PAH bands (8.6 mum and 11.3 mum) are distributed over different ranges for AGNs and SB galaxies, suggesting that these ratios could depend on the ionization fraction, as well as on the hardness of the radiation field. The ratio between the 7.7 mum and 11.3 mum bands is nearly constant with the increase of [Ne III]15.5 mum/[Ne II] 12.8 mum, indicating that the fraction of ionized to neutral PAH bands does not depend on the hardness of the radiation field. The equivalent width of both PAH features show the same dependence (strongly decreasing) with [Ne III]/[Ne II], suggesting that the PAH molecules, emitting either ionized (7.7 mum) or neutral (11.3 mum) bands, may be destroyed with the increase of the hardness of the radiation field.},

  abstract = {We examine the rest-frame far-infrared emission from powerful radio sources with 1.4-GHz luminosity densities of 25 <= log(L1.4/W Hz-1) <= 26.5 in the extragalactic Spitzer First Look Survey field. We combine Herschel/SPIRE flux densities with Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera and Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer infrared data to obtain total (?m) infrared luminosities for these radio sources. We separate our sources into a moderate, 0.4 < z < 0.9, and a high, 1.2 < z < 3.0, redshift sub-sample and we use Spitzer observations of a z < 0.1 3CRR sample as a local comparison. By comparison to numbers from the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) Simulated Skies, we find that our moderate-redshift sample is complete and our high-redshift sample is 14 per cent complete. We constrain the ranges of mean star formation rates (SFRs) to be 3.4-4.2, 18-41 and 80-581 M&sun; yr-1 for the local, moderate- and high-redshift samples, respectively. Hence, we observe an increase in the mean SFR with increasing redshift which we can parametrize as ˜(1 + z)Q, where Q = 4.2 $\pm$ 0.8. However, we observe no trends of mean SFR with radio luminosity within the moderate- or high-redshift bins. We estimate that radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the high-redshift sample contribute 0.1-0.5 per cent to the total SFR density at that epoch. Hence, if all luminous starbursts host radio-loud AGN we infer a radio-loud phase duty cycle of 0.001-0.005.  For reference, 2 per cent of the radio sources with unknown redshifts have significant detections in the SPIRE wavebands.},

@article{Kaviraj:2011kl,
  abstract = {Recent work (Schawinski et al.) indicates that star-forming early-type galaxies residing in the blue cloud migrate rapidly to the red sequence within around a Gyr, passing through several phases of increasingly strong active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in the process. We show that natural depletion of the cold gas reservoir through star formation (i.e. in the absence of any feedback from the AGN) induces a blue-to-red reddening rate that is several factors lower than that observed by Schawinski et al. This is because the gas depletion rate due to star formation alone is too slow, implying that another process needs to be invoked to remove cold gas from the system and accelerate the reddening rate. We develop a simple phenomenological model, in which a fraction of the AGN's luminosity couples to the gas reservoir over a certain 'feedback time-scale' and removes part of the cold gas mass from the galaxy, while the remaining gas continues to contribute to star formation. We use the model to investigate scenarios which yield migration times consistent with the results of Schawinski et al. We find that acceptable models have feedback time-scales ≲0.2 Gyr. The mass fraction in young stars in the remnants is ≲5 per cent and the residual cold gas fractions are less than 0.6 per cent, in good agreement with the recent literature. At least half of the initial cold gas reservoir is removed as the galaxies evolve from the blue cloud to the red sequence. If we restrict ourselves to feedback time-scales similar to the typical duty cycles of local AGN (a few hundred Myr) then a few tenths of a per cent of the luminosity of an early-type Seyfert (˜1011 L&sun;) must couple to the cold gas reservoir in order to produce migration times that are consistent with the observations.},

@article{Elbaz:2011qe,
  abstract = {We present the deepest 100 to 500 mum far-infrared observations obtained with the Herschel Space Observatory as part of the GOODS-Herschel key program, and examine the infrared (IR) 3-500 mum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at 0 < z < 2.5, supplemented by a local reference sample from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer, and AKARI data. We determine the projected star formation densities of local galaxies from their radio and mid-IR continuum sizes. We find that the ratio of total IR luminosity to rest-frame 8 mum luminosity, IR8 (≡ LIRtot), follows a Gaussian distribution centered on IR8 = 4 (sigma = 1.6) and defines an IR main sequence for star-forming galaxies independent of redshift and luminosity. Outliers from this main sequence produce a tail skewed toward higher values of IR8. This minority population (<20%) is shown to consist of starbursts with compact projected star formation densities. IR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star formation from compact starbursts with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness (SigmaIR > 3 × 1010 L&sun; kpc-2) and a high specific star formation rate (i.e., starbursts). The rest-frame, UV-2700 {\AA} size of these distant starbursts is typically half that of main sequence galaxies, supporting the correlation between star formation density and starburst activity that is measured for the local sample. Locally, luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies, (U)LIRGs (LIRtot), are systematically in the starburst mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the normal main sequence mode. This confusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called mid-IR excess population of galaxies found at z > 1.5 by previous studies. Main sequence galaxies have strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting from a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust ~ 15-50 K), and an effective Tdust ~ 31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their infrared SED. Galaxies in the starburst regime instead exhibit weak PAH equivalent widths and a sharper far-IR bump with an effective Tdust ~ 40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far IR emission of X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGN) is predominantly produced by star formation and that candidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically occur in compact, dusty starbursts. After correcting for the effect of starbursts on IR8, we identify new candidates for extremely obscured AGNs.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

@article{Armour:2012eu,
  abstract = {There is substantial evidence for a connection between star formation in the nuclear region of a galaxy and growth of the central supermassive black hole. Furthermore, starburst activity in the region around an active galactic nucleus (AGN) may provide the obscuration required by the unified model of AGNs. Molecular line emission is one of the best observational avenues to detect and characterize dense, star-forming gas in galactic nuclei over a range of redshift. This paper presents predictions for the carbon monoxide (CO) line features from models of nuclear starburst disks around AGNs. These small-scale (lsim 100 pc), dense and hot starbursts have CO luminosities similar to scaled-down ultra-luminous infrared galaxies and quasar host galaxies. Nuclear starburst disks that exhibit a pc-scale starburst and could potentially act as the obscuring torus show more efficient CO excitation and higher brightness temperature ratios than those without such a compact starburst. In addition, the compact starburst models predict strong absorption when J Upper >~ 10, a unique observational signature of these objects. These findings allow for the possibility that CO spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs) could be used to determine if starburst disks are responsible for the obscuration in z <~ 1 AGNs. Directly isolating the nuclear CO line emission of such compact regions around AGNs from galactic-scale emission will require high-resolution imaging or selecting AGN host galaxies with weak galactic-scale star formation. Stacking individual CO SLEDs will also be useful in detecting the predicted high-J features.},

Using optical morphologies from the Hubble Space Telescope and infrared photometry from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, we estimate star formation rate (SFR) surface densities that approach SigmaSFR ≈ 3000 M &sun; yr-1 kpc-2, comparable to the Eddington limit from radiation pressure on dust grains. We argue that feedback associated with a compact starburst in the form of radiation pressure from massive stars and ram pressure from supernovae and stellar winds is sufficient to produce the high-velocity outflows we observe, without the need to invoke feedback from an active galactic nucleus.},

@article{Rovilos:2012wd,
  abstract = {Models of galaxy evolution assume some connection between the AGN and star formation activity in galaxies. We use the multi-wavelength information of the CDFS to assess this issue. We select the AGNs from the 3 Ms XMM-Newton survey and measure the star-formation rates of their hosts using data that probe rest-frame wavelengths longward of 20 mum, predominantly from deep 100 mum and 160 mum Herschel observations, but also from Spitzer-MIPS-70 mum. Star-formation rates are obtained from spectral energy distribution fits, identifying and subtracting an AGN component. Our sample consists of sources in the z ≈ 0.5-4 redshift range, with star-formation rates SFR ≈ 101-103 M&sun; yr-1 and stellar masses M* ≈ 1010-1011.5 M&sun;. We divide the star-formation rates by the stellar masses of the hosts to derive specific star-formation rates (sSFR) and find evidence for a positive correlation between the AGN activity (proxied by the X-ray luminosity) and the sSFR for themost active systems with X-ray luminosities exceeding Lx ~= 1043 erg s-1 and redshifts z ≳ 1. We do not find evidence for such a correlation for lower luminosity systems or those at lower redshifts, consistent with previous studies. We do not find any correlation between the SFR (or the sSFR) and the X-ray absorption derived from high-quality XMM-Newton spectra either, showing that the absorption is likely to be linked to the nuclear region rather than the host, while the star-formation is not nuclear. Comparing the sSFR of the hosts to the characteristic sSFR of star-forming galaxies at the same redshift (the so-called main sequence) we find that the AGNs reside mostly in main-sequence and starburst hosts, reflecting the AGN-sSFR connection; however the infrared selection might bias this result. Limiting our analysis to the highest X-ray luminosity AGNs (X-ray QSOs with Lx > 1044 erg s-1), we find that the highest-redshift QSOs (with z ≳ 2) reside predominantly in starburst hosts, with an average sSFR more than double that of the main sequence, and we find a few cases of QSOs at z ≈ 1.5 with specific star-formation rates compatible with the main-sequence, or even in the quiescent region. Finally, we test the reliability of the colour-magnitude diagram (plotting the rest-frame optical colours against the stellar mass) in assessing host properties, and find a significant correlation between rest-frame colour (without any correction for AGN contribution or dust extinction) and sSFR excess relative to the main sequence at a given redshift. This means that the most starbursty objects have the bluest rest-frame colours.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.This work is based on observations obtained with XMM-Newton, an ESA science mission with instruments and contributions directly funded by ESA Member States and the USA (NASA).},

@article{La-Mura:2012cr,
  abstract = {The existence of correlations between the nuclear properties of galaxies, such as the mass of their central black holes, and larger scale features, such as the bulge mass and luminosity, represents a fundamental constraint on galaxy evolution. Although the actual reasons for these relations have not yet been identified, it is widely believed that they could stem from a connection between the processes that lead to black hole growth and stellar mass assembly. The problem of understanding how the processes of nuclear activity and star formation can affect each other became known to the literature as the starburst-active galactic nucleus (AGN) connection. Despite years of investigation, the physical mechanisms which lie at the basis of this relation are known only in part. In this work, we analyse the problem of star formation and nuclear activity in a large sample of galaxies. We study the relations between the properties of the nuclear environments and their host galaxies. We find that the mass of the stellar component within the galaxies of our sample is a critical parameter, which we have to consider in an evolutionary sequence, which provides further insight into the connection between AGN and star formation processes.},

@article{Weedman:2012rr,
  abstract = {Mid-infrared spectroscopic measurements from the Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) on Spitzer are given for 125 hard X-ray active galactic nuclei (AGNs; 14-195 keV) from the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) sample and for 32 AGNs with black hole masses (BHMs) from reverberation mapping. The 9.7 mum silicate feature in emission or absorption defines an infrared AGN classification describing whether AGNs are observed through dust clouds, indicating that 55% of the BAT AGNs are observed through dust. The mid-infrared dust continuum luminosity is shown to be an excellent indicator of intrinsic AGN luminosity, scaling closely with the hard X-ray luminosity, log nuL nu(7.8 mum)/L(X) = -0.31 $\pm$ 0.35, and independent of classification determined from silicate emission or absorption. Dust luminosity scales closely with BHM, log nuL nu(7.8 mum) = (37.2 $\pm$ 0.5) + 0.87 log BHM for luminosity in erg s-1 and BHM in M &sun;. The 100 most luminous type 1 quasars as measured in nuL nu(7.8 mum) are found by comparing Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) optically discovered quasars with photometry at 22 mum from the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), scaled to rest frame 7.8 mum using an empirical template determined from IRS spectra. The most luminous SDSS/WISE quasars have the same maximum infrared luminosities for all 1.5 < z < 5, reaching total infrared luminosity L IR = 1014.4 L &sun;. Comparing with dust-obscured galaxies from Spitzer and WISE surveys, we find no evidence of hyperluminous obscured quasars whose maximum infrared luminosities exceed the maximum infrared luminosities of optically discovered quasars. Bolometric luminosities L bol estimated from rest-frame optical or ultraviolet luminosities are compared to L IR. For the local AGN, the median log L IR/L bol = -0.35, consistent with a covering factor of 45% for the absorbing dust clouds. For the SDSS/WISE quasars, the median log L IR/L bol = 0.1, with extremes indicating that ultraviolet-derived L bol can be seriously underestimated even for type 1 quasars.},

@article{Yan:2013dq,
  abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) has completed its all-sky survey in four channels at 3.4-22 mum, detecting hundreds of millions of objects. We merge the WISE mid-infrared data with optical data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and provide a phenomenological characterization of WISE extragalactic sources. WISE is most sensitive at 3.4 mum (W1) and least sensitive at 22 mum (W4). The W1 band probes massive early-type galaxies out to z >~ 1. This is more distant than SDSS identified early-type galaxies, consistent with the fact that 28% of 3.4 mum sources have faint or no r-band counterparts (r > 22.2). In contrast, 92%-95% of 12 mum and 22 mum sources have SDSS optical counterparts with r <= 22.2. WISE 3.4 mum detects 89.8% of the entire SDSS QSO catalog at S/N W1 >7sigma, but only 18.9% at 22 mum with S/N W4 > 5sigma. We show that WISE colors alone are effective in isolating stars (or local early-type galaxies), star-forming galaxies, and strong active galactic nuclei (AGNs)/QSOs at z <~ 3. We highlight three major applications of WISE colors: (1) Selection of strong AGNs/QSOs at z <= 3 using W1 -- W2 > 0.8 and W2 < 15.2 criteria, producing a better census of this population. The surface density of these strong AGN/QSO candidates is 67.5 $\pm$ 0.14 deg--2. (2) Selection of dust-obscured, type-2 AGN/QSO candidates. We show that WISE W1 -- W2 > 0.8, W2 < 15.2 combined with r -- W2 > 6 (Vega) colors can be used to identify type-2 AGN candidates. The fraction of these type-2 AGN candidates is one-third of all WISE color-selected AGNs. (3) Selection of ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z ~ 2 with extremely red colors, r -- W4 > 14 or well-detected 22 mum sources lacking detections in the 3.4 and 4.6 mum bands. The surface density of z ~ 2 ULIRG candidates selected with r -- W4 > 14 is 0.9 $\pm$ 0.07 deg--2 at S/N W4 >= 5 (the corresponding, lowest flux density of 2.5 mJy), which is consistent with that inferred from smaller area Spitzer surveys. Optical spectroscopy of a small number of these high-redshift ULIRG candidates confirms our selection, and reveals a possible trend that optically fainter or r -- W4 redder candidates are at higher redshifts.},

@article{Wagner:2013lq,
  abstract = {We show, using global three-dimensional grid-based hydrodynamical simulations, that ultrafast outflows (UFOs) from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) result in considerable feedback of energy and momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. The AGN wind interacts strongly with the inhomogeneous, two-phase ISM consisting of dense clouds embedded in a tenuous, hot, hydrostatic medium. The outflow floods through the intercloud channels, sweeps up the hot ISM, and ablates and disperses the dense clouds. The momentum of the UFO is primarily transferred to the dense clouds via the ram pressure in the channel flow, and the wind-blown bubble evolves in the energy-driven regime. Any dependence on UFO opening angle disappears after the first interaction with obstructing clouds. On kpc scales, therefore, feedback by UFOs operates similarly to feedback by relativistic AGN jets. Negative feedback is significantly stronger if clouds are distributed spherically rather than in a disk. In the latter case, the turbulent backflow of the wind drives mass inflow toward the central black hole. Considering the common occurrence of UFOs in AGNs, they are likely to be important in the cosmological feedback cycles of galaxy formation.},

@article{Puchwein:2013bh,
  abstract = {Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation in representative regions of the Universe typically need to resort to subresolution models to follow some of the feedback processes crucial for galaxy formation. Here, we show that an energy-driven outflow model in which the wind velocity decreases and the wind mass loading increases in low-mass galaxies, as suggested by observations, can produce a good match to the low-mass end of the observed galaxy stellar mass function. The high-mass end can be recovered simultaneously if feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and a correction for diffuse stellar light plausibly missed in observations are included. We find, however, that the resolution requirements for simulations including AGN feedback are more demanding than for wind feedback alone, making our highest resolution simulations with AGN and winds only marginally converged. Encouragingly, our model is in reasonable agreement with the observed stellar mass functions at redshifts z = 1 and z = 2, and the observed redshift evolution of the cosmic star formation rate density. In addition, at least in simulations without AGN, our wind model accurately reproduces the observed gas to stellar mass ratios and specific star formation rates of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass. This agreement with a diverse set of data marks significant progress in hydrodynamically modelling the formation of a representative galaxy population. It also suggests that the mass flux in real galactic winds should strongly increase towards low-mass galaxies. Without this assumption, an overproduction of galaxies at the faint-end of the galaxy luminosity function seems inevitable in our models.},

@inproceedings{Heckman:2001ve,
  abstract = {In this contribution I summarize our current knowledge of the nature and significance of starburst-driven galactic superwinds. These flows are driven primarily by the kinetic energy supplied by supernovae. Superwinds are complex, multiphase phenomena requiring a panchromatic observational approach. They are ubiquitous in galaxies in which the global star-formation rate per unit area exceeds roughly 10-1 Msolar yr-1 kpc-2 (a condition satisfied by local starbursts and high-redshift Lyman break galaxies). Data on X-ray emission, optical line-emission, and optical/UV interstellar absorption lines together imply that the mass outflow rates are comparable to the star-formation rates and that the conversion of kinetic energy from supernovae to superwind is quite efficient (~30 to 100%). Measured/inferred outflow speeds range from a few × 102 to 103 km s-1 and appear to be independent of the rotation speed of the ``host'' galaxy. The outflows are dusty (dust/gas ratios of ~1% by mass). These properties imply that superwinds may have established the mass-metallicity relation in elliptical and bulges, polluted the intergalactic medium to a metallicity of ~10 to 30% solar, heated the intergalactic medium by up to ~1 kev per baryon, and ejected enough dust into the intergalactic medium to have potentially observable consequences.},

@article{Mullaney:2012gf,
  abstract = {We present a study of the infrared properties of X-ray selected, moderate-luminosity (i.e. LX= 1042-1044 erg s-1) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) up to z ≈ 3, in order to explore the links between star formation in galaxies and accretion on to their central black holes. We use 100 and 160 mu m fluxes from GOODS-Herschel - the deepest survey yet undertaken by the Herschel telescope - and show that in the vast majority of cases (i.e. >94 per cent) these fluxes are dominated by emission from the host galaxy. As such, these far-infrared bands provide an uncontaminated view of star formation in the AGN host galaxies. We find no evidence of any correlation between the X-ray and infrared luminosities of moderate AGNs at any redshift, suggesting that global star formation is decoupled from nuclear (i.e. AGN) activity in these galaxies. On the other hand, we confirm that the star formation rates of AGN hosts increase strongly with redshift, by a factor of 43+27- 18 from z < 0.1 to z = 2-3 for AGNs with the same range of X-ray luminosities. This increase is entirely consistent with the factor of 25-50 increase in the specific star formation rates (SSFRs) of normal, star-forming (i.e. main-sequence) galaxies over the same redshift range. Indeed, the average SSFRs of AGN hosts are only marginally (i.e. ≈20 per cent) lower than those of main-sequence galaxies at all surveyed redshifts, with this small deficit being due to a fraction of AGNs residing in quiescent (i.e. low SSFR) galaxies. We estimate that 79 $\pm$ 10 per cent of moderate-luminosity AGNs are hosted in main-sequence galaxies, 15 $\pm$ 7 per cent in quiescent galaxies and <10 per cent in strongly starbursting galaxies. We derive the fractions of all main-sequence galaxies at z < 2 that are experiencing a period of moderate nuclear activity, noting that it is strongly dependent on galaxy stellar mass (Mstars), rising from just a few per cent at Mstars˜ 1010 M&sun; to ≳20 per cent at Mstars>= 1011 M&sun;. Our results indicate that it is galaxy stellar mass that is most important in dictating whether a galaxy hosts a moderate-luminosity AGN. We argue that the majority of moderate nuclear activity is fuelled by internal mechanisms rather than violent mergers, which suggests that high-redshift disc instabilities could be an important AGN feeding mechanism.},

@article{Santini:2012ly,
  abstract = {We compare the average star formation (SF) activity in X-ray selected AGN hosts with a mass-matched control sample of inactive galaxies, including both star forming and quiescent sources, in the 0.5 < z < 2.5 redshift range. Recent observations carried out by PACS, the 60-210 mum photometric camera on board the Herschel Space Observatory, in GOODS-S, GOODS-N and COSMOS allow us to obtain an unbiased estimate of the far-IR luminosity, and hence of the SF properties, of the two samples. Accurate AGN host stellar mass estimates are obtained by decomposing their total emission into the stellar and the nuclear components. We report evidence of a higher average SF activity in AGN hosts with respect to the control sample of inactive galaxies. The level of SF enhancement is modest (~0.26 dex at ~3sigma confidence level) at low X-ray luminosities (LX ≲ 1043.5 erg s-1) and more pronounced (0.56 dex at > 10sigma confidence level) in the hosts of luminous AGNs. However, when comparing to star forming galaxies only, AGN hosts are found broadly consistent with the locus of their main sequence. We investigate the relative far-IR luminosity distributions of active and inactive galaxies, and find a higher fraction of PACS detected, hence normal and highly star forming systems among AGN hosts. Although different interpretations are possible, we explain our findings as a consequence of a twofold AGN growth path: faint AGNs evolve through secular processes, with instantaneous AGNaccretion not tightly linked to the current total SF in the host galaxy, while the luminous AGNs co-evolve with their hosts through periods of enhanced AGN activity and star formation, possibly through major mergers. While an increased SF activity with respect to inactive galaxies of similar mass is expected in the latter, we interpret the modest SF offsets measured in low-LX AGN hosts as either a) generated by non-synchronous accretion and SF histories in a merger scenario or b) due to possible connections between instantaneous SF and accretion that can be induced by smaller scale (non-major merger) mechanisms. Far-IR luminosity distributions favour the latter scenario.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.Throughout the paper, the wording inactive/active refers to galaxies lacking/showing nuclear activity (non-AGNs/AGNs), regardless of their star formation rate.},

@article{Stern:2012mz,
  abstract = {The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is an extremely capable and efficient black hole finder. We present a simple mid-infrared color criterion, W1 - W2 >= 0.8 (i.e., [3.4]-[4.6] >=0.8, Vega), which identifies 61.9 $\pm$ 5.4 active galactic nucleus (AGN) candidates per deg2 to a depth of W2 ~ 15.0. This implies a much larger census of luminous AGNs than found by typical wide-area surveys, attributable to the fact that mid-infrared selection identifies both unobscured (type 1) and obscured (type 2) AGNs. Optical and soft X-ray surveys alone are highly biased toward only unobscured AGNs, while this simple WISE selection likely identifies even heavily obscured, Compton-thick AGNs. Using deep, public data in the COSMOS field, we explore the properties of WISE-selected AGN candidates. At the mid-infrared depth considered, 160 muJy at 4.6 mum, this simple criterion identifies 78% of Spitzer mid-infrared AGN candidates according to the criteria of Stern et al. and the reliability is 95%. We explore the demographics, multiwavelength properties and redshift distribution of WISE-selected AGN candidates in the COSMOS field.},

  abstract = {Advancements in infrared (IR) interferometry open up the possibility to spatially resolve active galactic nuclei (AGNs) on the parsec-scale level and study the circumnuclear dust distribution, commonly referred to as the dust torus, that is held responsible for the type 1/type 2 dichotomy of AGNs. We used the mid-IR beam combiner MIDI together with the 8 m telescopes at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer to observe the nucleus of the Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 424, achieving an almost complete coverage of the uv-plane accessible by the available telescope configurations. We detect extended mid-IR emission with a relatively baseline- and model-independent mid-IR half-light radius of (2.0 $\pm$ 0.2) pc × (1.5 $\pm$ 0.3) pc (averaged over the 8-13 mum wavelength range). The extended mid-IR source shows an increasing size with wavelength. These properties are in agreement with the idea of dust heated in thermal equilibrium with the AGN. The orientation of the major axis in position angle ~ - 27$\,^{\circ}$ is closely aligned with the system axis as set by optical polarization observations. Torus models typically favor extension along the mid-plane at mid-IR wavelengths instead. Therefore, we conclude that the majority of the parsec-scale mid-IR emission (gsim60%) in this type 2 AGN originates from optically thin dust in the polar region of the AGN, a scenario consistent with the near- to far-IR spectral energy distribution. We suggest that a radiatively driven dusty wind, possibly launched in a puffed-up region of the inner hot part of the torus, is responsible for the polar dust. In this picture, the torus dominates the near-IR emission up to about 5 mum, while the polar dust is the main contributor to the mid-IR flux. Our results of NGC 424 are consistent with recent observations of the AGN in the Circinus galaxy and resemble large-scale characteristics of other objects. If our results reflect a general property of the AGN population, the current paradigm for interpreting and modeling the IR emission of AGNs has to be revised.},

@article{Rosario:2012fr,
  abstract = {We study relationships between star-formation rate (SFR) and the accretion luminosity and nuclear obscuration of X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGNs) using a combination of deep far-infrared (FIR) and X-ray data in three key extragalactic survey fields (GOODS-South, GOODS-North and COSMOS), as part of the PACS Evolutionary Probe (PEP) program. The use of three fields with differing areas and depths enables us to explore trends between the global FIR luminosity of the AGN hosts and the luminosity of the active nucleus across 4.5 orders of magnitude in AGN luminosity (LAGN) and spanning redshifts from the Local Universe to z = 2.5. Using imaging from the Herschel/PACS instrument in 2-3 bands, we combine FIR detections and stacks of undetected objects to arrive at mean fluxes for subsamples in bins of redshift and X-ray luminosity. We constrain the importance of AGN-heated dust emission in the FIR and confirm that the majority of the FIR emission of AGNs is produced by cold dust heated by star-formation in their host galaxies. We uncover characteristic trends between the mean FIR luminosity (L60) and accretion luminosity of AGNs, which depend both on LAGN and redshift. At low AGN luminosities, accretion and SFR are uncorrelated at all redshifts, consistent with a scenario where most low-luminosity AGNs are primarily fueled by secular processes in their host galaxies. At high AGN luminosities, a significant correlation is observed between L60 and LAGN, but only among AGNs at low and moderate redshifts (z < 1). We interpret this observation as a sign of the increasing importance of major-mergers in driving both the growth of super-massive black holes (SMBHs) and global star-formation in their hosts at high AGN luminosities. We also find evidence that the enhancement of SFR in luminous AGNs weakens or disappears at high redshifts (z > 1) suggesting that the role of mergers is less important at these epochs. At all redshifts, we find essentially no relationship between L60 and nuclear obscuration across five orders of magnitude in obscuring Hydrogen column density (NH), suggesting that various mechanisms are likely to be responsible for obscuring X-rays in active galaxies. We discuss a broad scenario which can account for these trends: one in which two different modes of AGN fueling operate in the low- and high-luminosity regimes of SMBH accretion. We postulate that the dominant mode of accretion among high-luminosity AGNs evolves with redshift. Our study, as well as a body of evidence from the literature and emerging knowledge about the properties of high redshift galaxies, supports this scenario.

  abstract = {We explore the effects of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and star formation activity on the infrared (0.3-1000 mum) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of luminous infrared galaxies from z = 0.5 to 4.0. We have compiled a large sample of 151 galaxies selected at 24 mum (S 24 >~ 100 muJy) in the GOODS-N and ECDFS fields for which we have deep Spitzer IRS spectroscopy, allowing us to decompose the mid-IR spectrum into contributions from star formation and AGN activity. A significant portion (~25%) of our sample is dominated by an AGN (>50% of the mid-IR luminosity) in the mid-IR. Based on the mid-IR classification, we divide our full sample into four sub-samples: z ~ 1 star-forming (SF) sources, z ~ 2 SF sources, AGNs with clear 9.7 mum silicate absorption, and AGNs with featureless mid-IR spectra. From our large spectroscopic sample and wealth of multi-wavelength data, including deep Herschel imaging at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mum, we use 95 galaxies with complete spectral coverage to create a composite SED for each sub-sample. We then fit a two-temperature component modified blackbody to the SEDs. We find that the IR SEDs have similar cold dust temperatures, regardless of the mid-IR power source, but display a marked difference in the warmer dust temperatures. We calculate the average effective temperature of the dust in each sub-sample and find a significant (~20 K) difference between the SF and AGN systems. We compare our composite SEDs to local templates and find that local templates do not accurately reproduce the mid-IR features and dust temperatures of our high-redshift systems. High-redshift IR luminous galaxies contain significantly more cool dust than their local counterparts. We find that a full suite of photometry spanning the IR peak is necessary to accurately account for the dominant dust temperature components in high-redshift IR luminous galaxies.

@article{Gonzalez-Martin:2012vn,
  abstract = {The unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN) claims that the properties of AGN depend on the viewing angle of the observer with respect to a toroidal distribution of dust surrounding the nucleus. Both the mid-infrared (MIR) attenuation and continuum luminosity are expected to be related to dust associated with the torus. Therefore, isolating the nuclear component is essential to study the MIR emission of AGN. We have compiled all the T-ReCS spectra (Gemini observatory) available in the N-band for 22 AGN: 5 Type-1 and 17 Type-2 AGN. The high angular resolution of the T-ReCs spectra allows us to probe physical regions of 57 pc (median). We have used a novel pipeline called RedCan capable of producing flux- and wavelength-calibrated spectra for the CanariCam (GTC) and T-ReCS (Gemini) instruments. We have measured the fine-structure [SIV] at 10.5 microns and the PAH at 11.3 microns line strengths together with the silicate absorption/emission features. We have also compiled Spitzer/IRS spectra to understand how spatial resolution influences the results. The 11.3 microns PAH feature is only clearly detected in the nuclear spectra of two AGN, while it is more common in the Spitzer data. For those two objects the AGN emission in NGC7130 accounts for more than 80% of the MIR continuum at 12 microns while in the case of NGC1808 the AGN is not dominating the MIR emission. This is confirmed by the correlation between the MIR and X-ray continuum luminosities. The [SIV] emission line at 10.5 microns, which is believed to originate in the narrow line region, is detected in most AGN. We have found an enhancement of the optical depth at 9.7 microns in the high-angular resolution data for higher values of NH. Clumpy torus models reproduce the observed values only if the host-galaxy properties are taken into account.},

  abstract = {We use infrared spectroscopy and photometry to empirically define the intrinsic mid- to far-infrared spectral energy distribution (i.e. 6-100 mum SED) of thermal emission produced by typical (i.e. 2-10 keV luminosity, L2-10 keV˜ 1042-1044 erg s-1) active galactic nuclei (hereafter AGNs). The average infrared SED of typical AGNs is best described as a broken power law at ≲40 mu m that falls steeply at ≳40 mum (i.e. at far-infrared wavelengths). Despite this fall-off at long wavelengths, at least three of the 11 AGNs in our sample have demonstrated SEDs that are AGN dominated even at 60 mu m, demonstrating the importance of accounting for any AGN contribution when calculating galaxy infrared luminosities. We find that the average intrinsic AGN 6-100 mu m SED gets bluer with increasing X-ray luminosity - a trend seen both within our sample and also when we compare it with the intrinsic SEDs of more luminous quasars (i.e. L2-10 keV≳ 1044 erg s-1). The range of intrinsic AGN SEDs is more closely matched by clumpy, rather than continuous, torus models. Using our intrinsic AGN SEDs we define a set of correction factors to convert either monochromatic infrared or X-ray luminosities into total (i.e. 8-1000 mum) AGN infrared luminosities. We outline a procedure that uses our newly defined intrinsic AGN infrared SEDs, in conjunction with a selection of host-galaxy templates, to measure the AGN contribution to the infrared output of composite galaxies from photometry alone. We verify the accuracy of our SED-fitting procedure by comparing our results to two independent measures of AGN contribution: (1) 12-mum luminosities obtained from high spatial resolution observations of nearby galaxies and (2) the equivalent width of the 11.25-mum PAH feature. Our SED-fitting procedure opens up the possibility of measuring the intrinsic AGN luminosities for large numbers of galaxies with well-sampled infrared data (e.g. IRAS, ISO, Spitzer and Herschel). The intrinsic AGN infrared SEDs, host-galaxy templates and a procedure used to combine them to fit infrared photometry are available at},

@article{Ivison:2010kx,
  abstract = {We set out to determine the ratio, qIR, of rest-frame 8-1000-mum flux, SIR, to monochromatic radio flux, S1.4 GHz, for galaxies selected at far-infrared (IR) and radio wavelengths, to search for signs that the ratio evolves with redshift, luminosity or dust temperature, Td, and to identify any far-IR-bright outliers - useful laboratories for exploring why the far-IR/radio correlation (FIRRC) is generally so tight when the prevailing theory suggests variations are almost inevitable. We use flux-limited 250-mum and 1.4-GHz samples, obtained using Herschel and the Very Large Array (VLA) in GOODS-North (-N). We determine bolometric IR output using ten bands spanning lambdaobs = 24-1250 mum, exploiting data from PACS and SPIRE (PEP; HerMES), as well as Spitzer, SCUBA, AzTEC and MAMBO. We also explore the properties of an LIR-matched sample, designed to reveal evolution of qIR with redshift, spanning log LIR = 11-12 L&sun; and z = 0-2, by stacking into the radio and far-IR images. For 1.4-GHz-selected galaxies in GOODS-N, we see tentative evidence of a break in the flux ratio, qIR, at L1.4 GHz ~ 1022.7 W Hz-1, where active galactic nuclei (AGN) are starting to dominate the radio power density, and of weaker correlations with redshift and Td. From our 250-mum-selected sample we identify a small number of far-IR-bright outliers, and see trends of qIR with L1.4 GHz, LIR, Td and redshift, noting that some of these are inter-related. For our LIR-matched sample, there is no evidence that qIR changes significantly as we move back into the epoch of galaxy formation: we find qIR ∝(1+z)gamma, where gamma = -0.04$\pm$0.03 at z = 0-2; however, discounting the least reliable data at z < 0.5 we find gamma = -0.26$\pm$0.07, modest evolution which may be related to the radio background seen by ARCADE 2, perhaps driven by <10-muJy radio activity amongst ordinary star-forming galaxies at z > 1.

  abstract = {We have identified 7824 radio sources from the 1.4GHz NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) with galaxies brighter than K = 12.75mag in the Second Incremental Data Release of the 6 degree Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGSDR2). The resulting sample of redshifts and optical spectra for radio sources over an effective sky area of 7076deg2 (about 17 per cent of the celestial sphere) is the largest of its kind ever obtained. NVSS radio sources associated with galaxies in the 6dFGS span a redshift range 0.003 < z < 0.3 and have median . Through visual examination of 6dF spectra we have identified the dominant mechanism for radio emission from each galaxy. 60 per cent are fuelled by star formation and 40 per cent are fuelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) powered by a supermassive black hole. We have accurately determined the local radio luminosity function (RLF) at 1.4GHz for both classes of radio source and have found it to agree well with other recent determinations. From the RLF of star-forming galaxies we derive a local star formation density of 0.022 +/- 0.001Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, in broad agreement with recent determinations at radio and other wavelengths.  We have split the RLF of radio-loud AGNs into bins of absolute K-band magnitude (MK) and compared this with the underlying K-band galaxy luminosity function of all 6dFGS galaxies to determine the bivariate radio-K-band luminosity function. We verify that radio-loud AGNs preferentially inhabit the brightest and hence most massive host galaxies and show that the fraction of all galaxies which host a radio-loud AGN scales as fradio-loud ~ L2.1K for fradio-loud < 0.3, indicative of a similarly strong scaling with black hole mass and stellar mass.},

@article{Jarvis:2010uq,
  abstract = {We use data from the Herschel-ATLAS to investigate the evolution of the far-infrared-radio correlation over the redshift range 0 < z < 0.5. Using the total far-infrared luminosity of all >5sigma sources in the Herschel-ATLAS Science Demonstration Field and cross-matching these data with radio data from the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimetres (FIRST) survey and the NRAO Very Large Array (VLA) Northern Sky Survey (NVSS), we obtain 104 radio counterparts to the Herschel sources. With these data we find no evidence for evolution in the far-infrared-radio correlation over the redshift range 0 < z < 0.5, where the median value for the ratio between far-infrared and radio luminosity, qIR, over this range is qIR = 2.40 +/- 0.12 (and a mean of qIR = 2.52 +/- 0.03 accounting for the lower limits), consistent with both the local value determined from IRAS and values derived from surveys targeting the high-redshift Universe. By comparing the radio fluxes of our sample measured from both FIRST and NVSS we show that previous results suggesting an increase in the value of qIR from high to low redshift may be the result of resolving out extended emission of the low-redshift sources with relatively high-resolution interferometric data, although contamination from active galactic nuclei could still play a significant role.  We also find tentative evidence that the longer wavelength cooler dust is heated by an evolved stellar population which does not trace the star formation rate as closely as the shorter wavelength <~ 250mum emission or the radio emission, supporting suggestions based on detailed models of individual galaxies.

  abstract = {FIR-radio luminosity correlations are presently derived for two statistically complete samples spanning a wide luminosity range. While observed correlations are tight, they are not linear; the observed scattering is mostly intrinsic. An empirical correction to the radio luminosities, based on observed blue luminosities, makes the corrected FIR-radio correlation linear and eliminates most of the residual variance. A two-component model that is consistent with the improved correlation is proposed for the heating luminosity within galaxies. The first, radio-loud component contains young massive stars that heat the dust, while contributing to the cool cirrus dust-heating interstellar radiation field. The second, radio-quiet component is made up of less massive older stars.},

@article{Kuraszkiewicz:2003lr,
  abstract = {Hard X-ray selection is, arguably, the optimal method for defining a representative sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Hard X-rays are unbiased by the effects of obscuration and reprocessing along the line of sight intrinsic/external to the AGN, which result in unknown fractions of the population being missed from traditional optical/soft X-ray samples. We present the far-infrared (far-IR) observations of 21 hard X-ray-selected AGNs from the HEAO 1 A2 sample observed with Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). We characterize the far-IR continua of these X-ray-selected AGNs and compare them with those of various radio and optically selected AGN samples and with models for an AGN-heated, dusty disk. The X-ray-selected AGNs show broad, warm IR continua covering a wide temperature range (~20-1000 K in a thermal emission scenario). Where a far-IR turnover is clearly observed, the slopes are less than 2.5 in all but three cases so that nonthermal emission remains a possibility, although the presence of cooler dust resulting in a turnover at wavelengths longward of the ISO range is considered more likely. The sample also shows a wider range of optical/UV shapes than the optical/radio-selected samples, extending to redder near-IR colors. The bluer objects are type 1 Seyfert galaxies, while the redder AGNs are mostly intermediate or type 2 Seyfert galaxies. This is consistent with a modified unification model in which obscuration increases as we move from a face-on toward a more edge-on line of sight. However, this relation does not extend to the mid-infrared as the 25/60 mum ratios are similar in Seyfert galaxies with differing type and optical/UV reddening. The resulting limits on the column density of obscuring material through which we are viewing the redder AGNs (NH~1022 cm-2) are inconsistent with standard optically thick torus models (NH~1024 cm-2) and simple unification models. Instead our results support more complex models in which the amount of obscuring material increases with viewing angle and may be clumpy. Such a scenario, already suggested by differing optical/near-IR spectroscopic and X-ray AGN classifications, allows for different amounts of obscuration of the continuum emission in different wave bands and of the broad emission line region, which, in turn, results in a mixture of behaviors for AGNs with similar optical emission-line classifications. The resulting decrease in the optical depth of the obscuring material also allows the AGN to heat more dust at larger radial distances. We show that an AGN-heated, flared, dusty disk with mass of ~109 Msolar and size of approximately a few hundred parsecs is able to generate optical-far-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) that reproduce the wide range of SEDs present in our sample with no need for an additional starburst component to generate the long-wavelength, cooler part of the IR continuum.  Based on observations with the Infrared Space Observatory, which is an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

  abstract = {We investigate the mid- (MIR) to far-infrared (FIR) properties of a nearly complete sample of local active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected in the Swift/Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) all-sky hard X-ray (14-195 keV) survey, based on the cross correlation with the AKARI infrared survey catalogs complemented by those with Infrared Astronomical Satellite and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. Out of 135 non-blazer AGNs in the Swift/BAT nine-month catalog, we obtain the MIR photometric data for 128 sources either in the 9, 12, 18, 22, and/or 25 mum band. We find good correlation between their hard X-ray and MIR luminosities over three orders of magnitude (42 < log lambdaL lambda(9, 18 mum) < 45), which is tighter than that with the FIR luminosities at 90 mum. This suggests that thermal emission from hot dusts irradiated by the AGN emission dominate the MIR fluxes. Both X-ray unabsorbed and absorbed AGNs follow the same correlation, implying isotropic infrared emission, as expected in clumpy dust tori rather than homogeneous ones. We find excess signals around 9 mum in the averaged infrared spectral energy distribution from heavy obscured new type AGNs with small scattering fractions in the X-ray spectra. This could be attributed to the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission feature, suggesting that their host galaxies have strong starburst activities.},

@article{Vagnetti:2012ve,
  abstract = {Variability, both in X-ray and optical/UV, affects the well-known anti-correlation between the $\alpha_{ox}$ spectral index and the UV luminosity of active galactic nuclei, contributing part of the dispersion around the average correlation (intra-source dispersion), in addition to the differences among the time-average $\alpha_{ox}$ values from source to source (inter-source dispersion). We want to evaluate the intrinsic $\alpha_{ox}$ variations in individual objects, and their effect on the dispersion of the $\alpha_{ox}-L_{UV}$ anti-correlation. We use simultaneous UV/X-ray data from Swift observations of a low-redshift sample, to derive the epoch-dependent $\alpha_{ox}(t)$ indices. We correct for the host galaxy contribution by a spectral fit of the optical/UV data. We compute ensemble structure functions to analyse variability of multi-epoch data. We find a strong intrinsic $\alpha_{ox}$ variability, which makes an important contribution ($\sim40%$ of the total variance) to the dispersion of the $\alpha_{ox}-L_{UV}$ anti-correlation (intra-source dispersion). The strong X-ray variability and weaker UV variability of this sample are comparable to other samples of low-z AGNs, and are neither due to the high fraction of strongly variable NLS1s, nor to dilution of the optical variability by the host galaxies. Dilution affects instead the slope of the anti-correlation, which steepens, once corrected, becoming similar to higher luminosity sources. The structure function of $\alpha_{ox}$ increases with the time lag up to $\sim month. This indicates the important contribution of the intermediate-long timescale variations, possibly generated in the outer parts of the accretion disk.},

  abstract = {We present some of the first science data with the new Keck/MOSFIRE instrument to test the effectiveness of different AGN/SF diagnostics at z~1.5. MOSFIRE spectra were obtained in three H-band multi-slit masks in the GOODS-S field, resulting in two hour exposures of 36 emission-line galaxies. We compare X-ray data with the traditional emission-line ratio diagnostics and the alternative mass-excitation and color-excitation diagrams, combining new MOSFIRE infrared data with previous HST/WFC3 infrared spectra (from the 3D-HST survey) and multiwavelength photometry. We demonstrate that a high [OIII]/Hb ratio is insufficient as an AGN indicator at z>1. For the four X-ray detected galaxies, the classic diagnostics ([OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha and [SII]/Ha) remain consistent with X-ray AGN/SF classification. The X-ray data also suggest that composite galaxies (with intermediate AGN/SF classification) host bona-fide AGNs. Nearly 2/3 of the z~1.5 emission-line galaxies have nuclear activity detected by either X-rays or the classic diagnostics. Compared to the X-ray and line ratio classifications, the mass-excitation method remains effective at z>1, but we show that the color-excitation method requires a new calibration to successfully identify AGNs at these redshifts.},

  abstract = {We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of 28 X-ray and mid-infrared selected sources at a median redshift of z~0.8 in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). To date this is the largest compilation of NIR spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at this redshift. The data were obtained using the multi-object spectroscopic mode of the Long-slit Intermediate Resolution Infrared Spectrograph (LIRIS) at the 4.2m William Herschel Telescope (WHT). These galaxies are representative of a larger sample studied in a previous work, consisting of over a hundred X-ray selected sources with mid-infrared counterparts, which were classified either as AGN-dominated or host galaxy-dominated, depending on the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Here we present new NIR spectra of 13 and 15 sources of each class respectively. We detect the H alpha line at > 1.5 sigma above the continuum for the majority of the galaxies. Using attenuation-corrected H alpha luminosities and observed Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron fluxes, and after subtracting an AGN component estimated using an AGN empirical correlation and multi-frequency SED fits, we obtain average star formation rates (SFRs) of 7+/-7 and 20+/-50 Msun/yr respectively (median SFRs = 7 and 5 Msun/yr). These values are lower than the SFRs reported in the literature for different samples of non-active star-forming galaxies of similar stellar masses and redshifts (M* ~ 10^11 Msun and z~1). In spite of the small size of the sample studied here, as well as the uncertainty affecting the AGN-corrected SFRs, we speculate with the possibility of AGN quenching the star formation in galaxies at z~0.8. Alternatively, we might be seeing a delay between the offset of the star formation and AGN activity, as observed in the local universe.},

Given the longevity of the RXTE mission, the greater part of our data is spread out over more than a decade, providing truly long-term average spectra and eliminating inconsistencies arising from variability. We present long-term average values of absorption, Fe line parameters, Compton reflection strengths, and photon indices, as well as fluxes and luminosities for the hard and very hard energy bands, 2-10 keV and 20-100 keV, respectively. We find tentative evidence for high-energy rollovers in three of our objects. We improve upon previous surveys of the very hard X-ray energy band in terms of accuracy and sensitivity, particularly with respect to confirming and quantifying the Compton reflection component. This survey is meant to provide a baseline for future analysis with respect to the long-term averages for these sources and to cement the legacy of RXTE, and especially its High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment, as a contributor to AGN spectral science.},

  abstract = {We compare mid-infrared emission-line properties from high-resolution Spitzer spectra of a hard X-ray (14-195 keV) selected sample of nearby (z < 0.05) active galactic nuclei (AGNs) detected by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) aboard Swift. The luminosity distribution for the mid-infrared emission lines, [O IV] 25.89 mum, [Ne II] 12.81 mum, [Ne III] 15.56 mum, and [Ne V] 14.32/24.32 mum, and hard X-ray continuum show no differences between Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2 populations; however, six newly discovered BAT AGNs are under-luminous in [O IV], most likely the result of dust extinction in the host galaxy. The overall tightness of the mid-infrared correlations and BAT fluxes and luminosities suggests that the emission lines primarily arise in gas ionized by the AGNs. We also compare the mid-infrared emission lines in the BAT AGNs with those from published studies of ULIRGs, Palomar-Green quasars, star-forming galaxies, and LINERs. We find that the BAT AGN sample falls into a distinctive region when comparing the [Ne III]/[Ne II] and the [O IV]/[Ne III] ratios. These line ratios are lower in sources that have been previously classified in the mid-infrared/optical as AGNs than those found for the BAT AGNs, suggesting that, in our X-ray selected sample, the AGNs represent the main contribution to the observed line emission. These ratios represent a new emission line diagnostic for distinguishing between AGNs and star-forming galaxies.},

@article{Sani:2012vn,
  abstract = {We present new ˜1 arcsec resolution data of the dense molecular gas in the central 50-100 pc of four nearby Seyfert galaxies. Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) observations of HCN and, in two of the four sources, simultaneously HCO+ allow us to carefully constrain the dynamical state of the dense gas surrounding the active galactic nuclei (AGN). The analysis of the kinematics shows large line widths of 100-200 km s-1 full width at half-maximum (FWHM) that can only partially arise from beam smearing of the velocity gradient. The observed morphological and kinematic parameters (dimensions, major axis position angle, red and blue channel separation, and integrated line width) are well reproduced by a thick disc, where the emitting dense gas has a large intrinsic dispersion (20-40 km s-1), implying that it exists at significant scale heights (25-30 per cent of the disc radius). To put the observed kinematics in the context of the starburst and AGN evolution, we estimate the Toomre Q parameter. We find this is always greater than the critical value, i.e. Q is above the limit such that the gas is stable against rapid star formation. This is supported by the lack of direct evidence, in these four Seyfert galaxies, for on-going star formation close around the AGN. Instead, any current star formation tends to be located in a circumnuclear ring. We conclude that the physical conditions are indeed not suited to star formation within the central ˜100 pc.},

  abstract = {We present infrared colours (in the 25-500 mum spectral range) and UV to radio continuum spectral energy distributions of a sample of 51 nearby galaxies observed with SPIRE on Herschel. The observed sample includes all morphological classes, from quiescent ellipticals to active starbursts. Active galaxies have warmer colour temperatures than normal spirals. In ellipticals hosting a radio galaxy, the far-infrared (FIR) emission is dominated by the synchrotron nuclear emission. The colour temperature of the cold dust is higher in quiescent E-S0a than in star-forming systems probably because of the different nature of their dust heating sources (evolved stellar populations, X-ray, fast electrons) and dust grain properties. In contrast to the colour temperature of the warm dust, the f350/f500 index sensitive to the cold dust decreases with star formation and increases with metallicity, suggesting an overabundance of cold dust or an emissivity parameter beta < 2 in low metallicity, active systems.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by Principal Investigator consortia. It is open for proposals for observing time from the worldwide astronomical community.},

  abstract = {We present photometry of the nearby galaxy NGC 5128 (Centaurus A) observed with the Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) and Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) instruments on board the Herschel Space Observatory, at 70, 160, 250, 350 and 500 mum, as well as new CO J= 3-2 observations taken with the HARP-B instrument on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). Using a single-component modified blackbody, we model the dust spectral energy distribution within the disc of the galaxy using all five Herschel wavebands and find dust temperatures of ˜30 K towards the centre of the disc and a smoothly decreasing trend to ˜20 K with increasing radius. We find a total dust mass of (1.59 $\pm$ 0.05) × 107 M&sun; and a total gas mass of (2.7 $\pm$ 0.2) × 109 M&sun;. The average gas-to-dust mass ratio is 103 $\pm$ 8, but we find an interesting increase in this ratio to approximately 275 towards the centre of Cen A. We discuss several possible physical processes that may be causing this effect, including dust sputtering, jet entrainment and systematic variables such as the XCO factor. Dust sputtering by X-rays originating in the active galactic nucleus or the removal of dust by the jets is our most favoured explanation.   a PACS values are divisive and SPIRE values are multiplicative.  b These uncertainties are for the pixels at their native pixel scale, as listed in this table.  c We have ignored the fact that the SPIRE calibration errors are correlated between all three bands and our total 7 per cent error comprises 5 per cent correlated error and 5 per cent uncorrelated error.},

@article{Hopkins:2010kx,
  abstract = {We use multiscale smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations to study the inflow of gas from galactic scales (~10kpc) down to <~ 0.1pc, at which point the gas begins to resemble a traditional, Keplerian accretion disc. The key ingredients of the simulations are gas, stars, black holes (BHs), self-gravity, star formation and stellar feedback (via a subgrid model); BH feedback is not included. We use ~100 simulations to survey a large parameter space of galaxy properties and subgrid models for the interstellar medium physics. We generate initial conditions for our simulations of galactic nuclei (<~ 300pc) using galaxy-scale simulations, including both major galaxy mergers and isolated bar-(un)stable disc galaxies. For sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems, we find that a series of gravitational instabilities generates large accretion rates of up to ~ 1-10 Msolar yr-1 on to the BH (i.e. at <~ 0.1pc) this is comparable to what is needed to fuel the most luminous quasars. The BH accretion rate is highly time variable for a given set of conditions in the galaxy at ~kpc. At radii of >rsim 10 pc, our simulations resemble the `bars-within-bars' model of Shlosman et al., but we show that the gas can have a diverse array of morphologies, including spirals, rings, clumps and bars; the duty cycle of these features is modest, complicating attempts to correlate BH accretion with the morphology of gas in galactic nuclei. At ~ 1-10 pc, the gravitational potential becomes dominated by the BH and bar-like modes are no longer present. However, we show that the gas can become unstable to a standing, eccentric disc or a single-armed spiral mode (m = 1), in which the stars and gas precess at different rates, driving the gas to sub-pc scales (again for sufficiently gas-rich, disc-dominated systems). A proper treatment of this mode requires including star formation and the self-gravity of both the stars and gas (which has not been the case in many previous calculations). Our simulations predict a correlation between the BH accretion rate and the star formation rate at different galactic radii. We find that nuclear star formation is more tightly coupled to active galactic nucleus activity than the global star formation rate of a galaxy, but a reasonable correlation remains even for the latter.},

@article{Tombesi:2015fj,
  abstract = {Powerful winds driven by active galactic nuclei are often thought to affect the evolution of both supermassive black holes and their host galaxies, quenching star formation and explaining the close relationship between black holes and galaxies. Recent observations of large-scale molecular outflows in ultraluminous infrared galaxies support this quasar-feedback idea, because they directly trace the gas from which stars form. Theoretical models suggest that these outflows originate as energy-conserving flows driven by fast accretion-disk winds. Proposed connections between large-scale molecular outflows and accretion-disk activity in ultraluminous galaxies were incomplete because no accretion-disk wind had been detected. Conversely, studies of powerful accretion-disk winds have until now focused only on X-ray observations of local Seyfert galaxies and a few higher-redshift quasars. Here we report observations of a powerful accretion-disk wind with a mildly relativistic velocity (a quarter that of light) in the X-ray spectrum of IRAS F11119+3257, a nearby (redshift 0.189) optically classified type 1 ultraluminous infrared galaxy hosting a powerful molecular outflow. The active galactic nucleus is responsible for about 80 per cent of the emission, with a quasar-like luminosity of 1.5 × 1046 ergs per second. The energetics of these two types of wide-angle outflows is consistent with the energy-conserving mechanism that is the basis of the quasar feedback in active galactic nuclei that lack powerful radio jets (such jets are an alternative way to drive molecular outflows).},

  abstract = {We present a measurement of the average supermassive black hole accretion rate (BHAR) as a function of the star formation rate (SFR) for galaxies in the redshift range 0.25 < z < 0.8. We study a sample of 1767 far-IR-selected star-forming galaxies in the 9 deg2 Bo{\"o}tes multi-wavelength survey field. The SFR is estimated using 250 mum observations from the Herschel Space Observatory, for which the contribution from the active galactic nucleus (AGN) is minimal. In this sample, 121 AGNs are directly identified using X-ray or mid-IR selection criteria. We combined these detected AGNs and an X-ray stacking analysis for undetected sources to study the average BHAR for all of the star-forming galaxies in our sample. We find an almost linear relation between the average BHAR (in M &sun; yr-1) and the SFR (in M &sun; yr-1) for galaxies across a wide SFR range 0.85 < log SFR < 2.56: log BHAR = (- 3.72 $\pm$ 0.52) + (1.05 $\pm$ 0.33)log SFR. This global correlation between SFR and average BHAR is consistent with a simple picture in which SFR and AGN activity are tightly linked over galaxy evolution timescales.},

@article{Keel:2012qy,
  abstract = {Some active galactic nuclei (AGN) are surrounded by extended emission-line regions (EELRs), which trace both the illumination pattern of escaping radiation and its history over the light travel time from the AGN to the gas. From a new set of such EELRs, we present evidence that the AGN in many Seyfert galaxies undergo luminous episodes 0.2-2 ? years in duration. Motivated by the discovery of the spectacular nebula known as Hanny's Voorwerp, ionized by a powerful AGN which has apparently faded dramatically within ? years, Galaxy Zoo volunteers have carried out both targeted and serendipitous searches for similar emission-line clouds around low-redshift galaxies. We present the resulting list of candidates and describe spectroscopy identifying 19 galaxies with AGN-ionized regions at projected radii ? kpc. This search recovered known EELRs (such as Mrk 78, Mrk 266 and NGC 5252) and identified additional previously unknown cases, one with detected emission to ? kpc. One new Sy 2 was identified. At least 14/19 are in interacting or merging systems, suggesting that tidal tails are a prime source of distant gas out of the galaxy plane to be ionized by an AGN. We see a mix of one- and two-sided structures, with observed cone angles from 23? to 112?. We consider the energy balance in the ionized clouds, with lower and upper bounds on ionizing luminosity from recombination and ionization-parameter arguments, and estimate the luminosity of the core from the far-infrared data. The implied ratio of ionizing radiation seen by the clouds to that emitted by the nucleus, on the assumption of a non-variable nuclear source, ranges from 0.02 to ?; 7/19 exceed unity. Small values fit well with a heavily obscured AGN in which only a small fraction of the ionizing output escapes to be traced by surrounding gas. However, large values may require that the AGN has faded over tens of thousands of years, giving us several examples of systems in which such dramatic long-period variation has occurred; this is the only current technique for addressing these time-scales in AGN history. The relative numbers of faded and non-faded objects we infer, and the projected extents of the ionized regions, give our estimate (0.2-2 ? years) for the length of individual bright phases.},

@article{Lintott:2009fk,
  abstract = {We report the discovery of an unusual object near the spiral galaxy IC2497, discovered by visual inspection of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) as part of the Galaxy Zoo project. The object, known as Hanny's Voorwerp, is bright in the SDSS g band due to unusually strong [OIII]4959, 5007 emission lines. We present the results of the first targeted observations of the object in the optical, ultraviolet and X-ray, which show that the object contains highly ionized gas. Although the line ratios are similar to extended emission-line regions near luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN), the source of this ionization is not apparent. The emission-line properties, and lack of X-ray emission from IC2497, suggest either a highly obscured AGN with a novel geometry arranged to allow photoionization of the object but not the galaxy's own circumnuclear gas, or, as we argue, the first detection of a quasar light echo. In this case, either the luminosity of the central source has decreased dramatically or else the obscuration in the system has increased within 105yr. This object may thus represent the first direct probe of quasar history on these time-scales.

@article{Keel:2014lr,
  abstract = {We present narrow- and medium-band HST imaging, with additional supporting ground-based data, for 8 galaxies identified as hosting fading AGN. These have AGN-ionized gas projected >10 kpc from the nucleus, and significant shortfall of ionizing radiation between the distant gas and the AGN, indicating fading AGN on ~50,000-year timescales. Every system shows evidence of ongoing or past interactions; a similar sample of obscured AGN with extended ionized clouds shares this incidence of disturbances. Several systems show multiple dust lanes in different orientations, broadly fit by differentially precessing disks of accreted material ~1.5 Gyr after initial arrival. The gas has lower metallicity than the nuclei; three systems have abundances uniformly well below solar, consistent with an origin in tidally disrupted low-luminosity galaxies, while some systems have more nearly solar abundances (accompanied by such signatures as multiple Doppler components), which may suggest redistribution of gas by outflows within the host galaxies themselves. These aspects are consistent with a tidal origin for the extended gas in most systems, although the ionized gas and stellar tidal features do not always match closely. In contrast to clouds near radio-loud AGN, these are dominated by rotation, in some cases in warped disks. Outflows are important only in localized regions near some of the AGN. In UGC 7342 and UGC 11185, luminous star clusters are seen within projected ionization cones, potentially triggered by outflows. As in the discovery example Hanny's Voorwerp/IC 2497, some clouds lack a strong correlation between H-alpha surface brightness and ionization parameter, indicating unresolved fine structure. Together with thin coherent filaments spanning several kpc, persistence of these structures over their orbital lifetimes may require a role for magnetic confinement. (Abridged)},

@article{Dale:2002ty,
  abstract = {New far-infrared and submillimeter data are used to solidify and to extend to long wavelengths the empirical calibration of the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of normal star-forming galaxies. As was found by Dale and coworkers in 2001, a single parameter family, characterized by fnu(60mum)/fnu(100mum), is adequate to describe the range of normal galaxy SEDs observed by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite and Infrared Space Observatory from 3 to 100 mum. However, predictions based on the first-generation models at longer wavelengths (122-850 mum) are increasingly overluminous compared to the data for smaller fnu(60mum)/fnu(100mum), or alternatively, for weaker global interstellar radiation fields. After slightly modifying the far-infrared/submillimeter dust emissivity in those models as a function of the radiation field intensity to better match the long-wavelength data, a suite of SEDs from 3 mum to 20 cm in wavelength is presented. Results from relevant applications are also discussed, including submillimeter-based photometric redshift indicators, the infrared energy budget and simple formulae for recovering the bolometric infrared luminosity, and dust mass estimates in galaxies. Regarding the latter, since galaxy infrared SEDs are not well described by single blackbody curves, the usual methods of estimating dust masses can be grossly inadequate. The improved model presented herein is used to provide a more accurate relation between infrared luminosity and dust mass.},

@article{Maiolino:1995nr,
  abstract = {We present new 10 microns (N-band) photometry for 70 Seyfert galaxies, 43 of them previously unobserved. These observations, together with those collected from the literature, complete the 10 microns photometry for the CfA Sy galaxies and cover 80% of the Sy found in the RSA and 70% of the Sy in the IRAS 12 microns sample.  From this data set, we find that Sy not showing any evidence for broad lines are systematically weaker in 10 microns nuclear emission than Sy nuclei having broad lines.  This result may indicate the existence of a group of very low-luminosity Sy2 galaxies that do not have Sy1 counterparts in equal numbers, contrary to the strict unified theory. Alternately, the result can be reconciled with unified theories if a specific type of geometry is assumed for the circumnuclear obscuring material.  By comparing the 10 microns ground-based observations with the IRAS 12 microns fluxes, we also study the properties of the extended mid-IR emission, i.e., the star forming activity of the host galaxy of the Sy nucleus. We find Sy2 to lie preferentially in galaxies experiencing enhanced star-forming activity, while Sy1 lie in normal or quiescent galaxies. This result appears to be inconsistent with the strict unified model, since the host galaxy properties should be independent of the orientation of a circumnuclear torus and therefore should be independent of nuclear type.  Our finding could be explained by adding to the unified model a link between star-forming activity and the amount of obscuring material collected in the circumnuclear region.},

The CO properties of 29 Seyferts in the Revised Shapley Ames Catalog (RSA) are compared with the CO properties of normal galaxies of the same Hubble type. These RSA type 2 Seyferts have an average ratio of CO-to-blue luminosity that is about twice as large as that of the normal galaxies, but the RSA type 1 Seyferts have normal CO luminosities. The RSA type 2 Seyfert galaxies have an unusually large average ratio of CO luminosity-to-H I mass compared to normal disk galaxies. The RSA type 2 Seyferts have an average far-IR luminosity that is about four times larger than a non-Seyfert comparison sample, while the RSA type 1 Seyferts are not significantly more luminous than the non-Seyferts. The result imply that the two classes of Seyferts are intrinsically different from one another and that one class cannot evolve into another in less than a few million years.},

@article{Viero:2014jk,
  abstract = {We present the first set of maps and band-merged catalog from the Herschel Stripe 82 Survey (HerS). Observations at 250, 350, and 500 mum were taken with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver instrument aboard the Herschel Space Observatory. HerS covers 79 deg2 along the SDSS Stripe 82 to an average depth of 13.0, 12.9, and 14.8 mJy beam-1 (including confusion) at 250, 350, and 500 mum, respectively. HerS was designed to measure correlations with external tracers of the dark matter density field---either point-like (i.e., galaxies selected from radio to X-ray) or extended (i.e., clusters and gravitational lensing)---in order to measure the bias and redshift distribution of intensities of infrared-emitting dusty star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei. By locating HerS in Stripe 82, we maximize the overlap with available and upcoming cosmological surveys. The band-merged catalog contains 3.3 × 104 sources detected at a significance of >~ 3sigma (including confusion noise). The maps and catalog are available at http://www.astro.caltech.edu/hers/.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

@article{Hernan-Caballero:2015lr,
  abstract = {We present results on the spectral decomposition of 118 Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra from local active galactic nuclei (AGN) using a large set of Spitzer/IRS spectra as templates. The templates are themselves IRS spectra from extreme cases where a single physical component (stellar, interstellar, or AGN) completely dominates the integrated mid-infrared emission. We show that a linear combination of one template for each physical component reproduces the observed IRS spectra of AGN hosts with unprecedented fidelity for a template fitting method, with no need to model extinction separately. We use full probability distribution functions to estimate expectation values and uncertainties for observables, and find that the decomposition results are robust against degeneracies. Furthermore, we compare the AGN spectra derived from the spectral decomposition with sub-arcsecond resolution nuclear photometry and spectroscopy from ground-based observations. We find that the AGN component derived from the decomposition closely matches the nuclear spectrum, with a 1-sigma dispersion of 0.12 dex in luminosity and typical uncertainties of ~0.19 in the spectral index and ~0.1 in the silicate strength. We conclude that the emission from the host galaxy can be reliably removed from the IRS spectra of AGN. This allows for unbiased studies of the AGN emission in intermediate and high redshift galaxies -currently inaccesible to ground-based observations- with archival Spitzer/IRS data and in the future with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope. The decomposition code and templates are available at http://www.denebola.org/ahc/deblendIRS.},

  abstract = {We present near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations of 28 X-ray and mid-infrared selected sources at a median redshift of z ˜ 0.8 in the Extended Groth Strip (EGS). To date this is the largest compilation of NIR spectra of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at this redshift. The data were obtained using the multi-object spectroscopic mode of the Long-slit Intermediate Resolution Infrared Spectrograph (LIRIS) at the 4.2 m William Herschel Telescope (WHT). These galaxies are representative of a larger sample studied in a previous work, consisting of over a hundred X-ray selected sources with mid-infrared counterparts, which were classified either as AGN dominated or host galaxy dominated, depending on the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). Here, we present new NIR spectra of 13 and 15 sources of each class, respectively. We detect the Halpha line at >=1.5sigma above the continuum for the majority of the galaxies. Using attenuation-corrected Halpha luminosities and observed Spitzer/MIPS 24 mum fluxes, and after subtracting an AGN component estimated using an AGN empirical correlation and multifrequency SED fits, we obtain average star formation rates (SFRs) of 7 $\pm$ 7 and 20 $\pm$ 50 M&sun; yr-1, respectively (median SFRs = 7 and 5 M&sun; yr-1). These values are lower than the SFRs reported in the literature for different samples of non-active star-forming galaxies of similar stellar masses and redshifts (M* ˜ 1011 M&sun; and z ˜ 1). In spite of the small size of the sample studied here, as well as the uncertainty affecting the AGN-corrected SFRs, we speculate with the possibility of AGN quenching the star formation in galaxies at z ˜ 0.8. Alternatively, we might be seeing a delay between the offset of the star formation and AGN activity, as observed in the local Universe.},

@article{Trump:2013oj,
  abstract = {We present some of the first science data with the new Keck/MOSFIRE instrument to test the effectiveness of different AGN/SF diagnostics at z ~ 1.5. MOSFIRE spectra were obtained in three H-band multi-slit masks in the GOODS-S field, resulting in 2 hr exposures of 36 emission-line galaxies. We compare X-ray data with the traditional emission-line ratio diagnostics and the alternative mass-excitation and color-excitation diagrams, combining new MOSFIRE infrared data with previous HST/WFC3 infrared spectra (from the 3D-HST survey) and multiwavelength photometry. We demonstrate that a high [O III]/Hbeta ratio is insufficient as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) indicator at z > 1. For the four X-ray-detected galaxies, the classic diagnostics ([O III]/Hbeta versus [N II]/Halpha and [S II]/Halpha) remain consistent with X-ray AGN/SF classification. The X-ray data also suggest that composite galaxies (with intermediate AGN/SF classification) host bona fide AGNs. Nearly ~2/3 of the z ~ 1.5 emission-line galaxies have nuclear activity detected by either X-rays or the classic diagnostics. Compared to the X-ray and line ratio classifications, the mass-excitation method remains effective at z > 1, but we show that the color-excitation method requires a new calibration to successfully identify AGNs at these redshifts.  Based on observations with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, obtained at the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by AURA, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555. Also based on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, made possible by the generous financial support of the W. M. Keck Foundation and operated as a scientific partnership among Caltech, the University of California, and NASA.},

The Swift-BAT 70 month survey has detected 1171 hard X-ray sources (more than twice as many sources as the previous 22 month survey) in the 14-195 keV band down to a significance level of 4.8sigma, associated with 1210 counterparts. The 70 month Swift-BAT survey is the most sensitive and uniform hard X-ray all-sky survey and reaches a flux level of 1.03 × 10-11 erg s-1 cm-2 over 50% of the sky and 1.34 × 10-11 erg s-1 cm-2 over 90% of the sky. The majority of new sources in the 70 month survey continue to be active galactic nuclei, with over 700 in the catalog. As part of this new edition of the Swift-BAT catalog, we also make available eight-channel spectra and monthly sampled light curves for each object detected in the survey in the online journal and at the Swift-BAT 70 month Web site.},

@article{Vagnetti:2013eq,
  abstract = {Context. Variability, both in X-ray and optical/UV, affects the well-known anti-correlation between the alphaox spectral index and the UV luminosity of active galactic nuclei, contributing part of the dispersion around the average correlation (intra-source dispersion) in addition to the differences among the time-average alphaox values from source to source (inter-source dispersion).  Aims: We aim to evaluate the intrinsic alphaox variations in individual objects and their effect on the dispersion of the alphaox - LUV anti-correlation.  Methods: We used simultaneous UV/X-ray data from Swift observations of a low-redshift sample to derive the epoch-dependent alphaox(t) indices. We corrected for the host galaxy contribution by a spectral fit of the optical/UV data. We computed ensemble structure functions to analyse the variability of multi-epoch data.  Results: We find a strong intrinsic alphaox variability, which significantly contributes (~40% of the total variance) to the dispersion of the alphaox - LUV anti-correlation (intra-source dispersion). The strong X-ray variability and weaker UV variability of this sample are comparable to other samples of low-z active galactic nuclei, and are neither caused by the high fraction of strongly variable narrow line Seyfert 1 galaxies, nor by dilution of the optical variability by the host galaxies. Dilution instead affects the slope of the anti-correlation, which steepens, once corrected, and becomes similar to higher luminosity sources. The structure function of alphaox increases with the time lag up to about one month. This indicates the important contribution of the intermediate-to-long timescale variations, which are possibly generated in the outer parts of the accretion disk.

@article{Gonzalez-Martin:2013by,
  abstract = {Context. The unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN) claims that the properties of AGN depend on the viewing angle of the observer with respect to a toroidal distribution of dust surrounding the nucleus. Both the mid-infrared (MIR) attenuation and continuum luminosity are expected to be related to dust associated with the torus. Therefore, isolating the nuclear component is essential for studying the MIR emission of AGN.  Aims: This work is aimed at studying the MIR emission of AGN with the highest spatial resolution available to date, isolating its contribution from extended emission. We would like to address three fundamental questions: (1) how important is the AGN contribution to the MIR spectrum; (2) where dust attenuation arises; and (3) how does spatial resolution affect these issues.  Methods: We compiled all the T-ReCS spectra (Gemini Observatory) available in the N-band for 22 AGN: 5 Type-1 and 17 Type-2 AGN. The high angular resolution of the T-ReCS spectra allowed us to probe physical regions of 57 pc (median). We used a novel pipeline called RedCan capable of producing flux- and wavelength-calibrated spectra for the CanariCam (GTC) and T-ReCS (Gemini) instruments. We measured the fine-structure [S IV] at 10.5 mum and the PAH at 11.3 mum line strengths, together with the silicate absorption/emission features. We also compiled Spitzer/IRS spectra to understand how spatial resolution influences the results. We complemented our sample with the results of 19 VISIR/VLT spectra (Paranal Observatory) and 20 nearby, highly obscured AGN (NH > 1.5 × 1024 cm-2) Spitzer spectra.  Results: The 11.3 mum PAH feature is only clearly detected in the nuclear spectra of two AGN, while it is more common in the Spitzer data. For those two objects, the AGN emission in NGC 7130 accounts for more than 80% of the MIR continuum at 12 mum, while in the case of NGC 1808 the AGN does not dominate the MIR emission. This is confirmed by the correlation between the MIR and X-ray continuum luminosities. The [S IV] emission line at 10.5 mum, which is believed to originate in the narrow line region, is detected in most AGN. We have found an enhancement of the optical depth at 9.7 mum (tau9.7) in the high-angular resolution data for higher values of NH. Clumpy torus models reproduce the observed values only if the host-galaxy properties are taken into account.  Appendix A is available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

@article{Johnson:2013uk,
  abstract = {We present a large-scale study of the X-ray properties and near-IR-to-radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) detected at 1.1 mm with the AzTEC instrument across a ˜1.2 square degree area of the sky. Combining deep 2-4 Ms Chandra data with Spitzer IRAC/MIPS and Very Large Array data within the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey North (GOODS-N), GOODS-S and COSMOS fields, we find evidence for active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity in ˜14 per cent of 271 AzTEC SMGs, ˜28 per cent considering only the two GOODS fields. Through X-ray spectral modelling and multiwavelength SED fitting using Monte Carlo Markov chain techniques to Siebenmorgen et al. (AGN) and Efstathiou, Rowan-Robinson & Siebenmorgen (starburst) templates, we find that while star formation dominates the IR emission, with star formation rates (SFRs) ˜100-1000 M&sun; yr-1, the X-ray emission for most sources is almost exclusively from obscured AGNs, with column densities in excess of 1023 cm-2. Only for ˜6 per cent of our sources do we find an X-ray-derived SFR consistent with NIR-to-radio SED derived SFRs. Inclusion of the X-ray luminosities as a prior to the NIR-to-radio SED effectively sets the AGN luminosity and SFR, preventing significant contribution from the AGN template. Our SED modelling further shows that the AGN and starburst templates typically lack the required 1.1 mm emission necessary to match observations, arguing for an extended, cool dust component. The cross-correlation function between the full samples of X-ray sources and SMGs in these fields does not indicate a strong correlation between the two populations at large scales, suggesting that SMGs and AGNs do not necessarily trace the same underlying large-scale structure. Combined with the remaining X-ray-dim SMGs, this suggests that sub-mm-bright sources may evolve along multiple tracks, with X-ray-detected SMGs representing transitionary objects between periods of high star formation and AGN activity, while X-ray-faint SMGs represent a brief starburst phase of more normal galaxies.},

  abstract = {We present deep 450 mum and 850 mum observations of a large, uniformly covered 394 arcmin2 area in the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) field obtained with the SCUBA-2 instrument on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT). We achieve root-mean-square noise values of sigma450 = 4.13 mJy and sigma850 = 0.80 mJy. The differential and cumulative number counts are presented and compared to similar previous works. Individual point sources are identified at >3.6sigma significance, a threshold corresponding to a 3-5 per cent sample contamination rate. We identify 78 sources at 450 mum and 99 at 850 mum, with flux densities S450 = 13-37 mJy and S850 = 2-16 mJy. Only 62-76 per cent of 450 mum sources are 850 mum detected and 61-81 per cent of 850 mum sources are 450 mum detected. The positional uncertainties at 450 mum are small (1-2.5 arcsec) and therefore allow a precise identification of multiwavelength counterparts without reliance on detection at 24 mum or radio wavelengths; we find that only 44 per cent of 450 mum sources and 60 per cent of 850 mum sources have 24 mum or radio counterparts. 450 mum selected galaxies peak at <z> = 1.95 $\pm$ 0.19 and 850 mum selected galaxies peak at <z> = 2.16 $\pm$ 0.11. The two samples occupy similar parameter space in redshift and luminosity, while their median SED peak wavelengths differ by ˜20-50 mum (translating to DeltaTdust = 8-12 K, where 450 mum selected galaxies are warmer). The similarities of the 450 mum and 850 mum populations, yet lack of direct overlap between them, suggests that submillimetre surveys conducted at any single far-infrared wavelength will be significantly incomplete (≳30 per cent) at censusing infrared-luminous star formation at high z.},

@article{LaMassa:2013hb,
  abstract = {Using the spectra of a sample of ~28,000 nearby obscured active galaxies from Data Release 7 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), we probe the connection between active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity and star formation over a range of radial scales in the host galaxy. We use the extinction-corrected luminosity of the [O III] 5007 {\AA} line as a proxy of intrinsic AGN power and supermassive black hole (SMBH) accretion rate. The star formation rates (SFRs) are taken from the MPA-JHU value-added catalog and are measured through the 3'' SDSS aperture. We construct matched samples of galaxies covering a range in redshifts. With increasing redshift, the projected aperture size encompasses increasing amounts of the host galaxy. This allows us to trace the radial distribution of star formation as a function of AGN luminosity. We find that the star formation becomes more centrally concentrated with increasing AGN luminosity and Eddington ratio. This implies that such circumnuclear star formation is associated with AGN activity, and that it increasingly dominates over omnipresent disk star formation at higher AGN luminosities, placing critical constraints on theoretical models that link host galaxy star formation and SMBH fueling. We parameterize this relationship and find that the star formation on radial scales <1.7 kpc, when including a constant disk component, has a sub-linear dependence on SMBH accretion rate: SFR \propto \dot{M}^{0.36}, suggesting that angular momentum transfer through the disk limits accretion efficiency rather than the supply from stellar mass loss.},

@article{Mendez:2013cl,
  abstract = {We present a study of Spitzer/IRAC and X-ray active galactic nucleus (AGN) selection techniques in order to quantify the overlap, uniqueness, contamination, and completeness of each. We investigate how the overlap and possible contamination of the samples depend on the depth of both the IR and X-ray data. We use Spitzer/IRAC imaging, Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging, and spectroscopic redshifts from the PRism MUlti-object Survey to construct galaxy and AGN samples at 0.2 < z < 1.2 over 8 deg2. We construct samples over a wide range of IRAC flux limits (SWIRE to GOODS depth) and X-ray flux limits (10 ks to 2 Ms). We compare IR-AGN samples defined using both the IRAC color selection of Stern et al. and Donley et al. with X-ray-detected AGN samples. For roughly similar depth IR and X-ray surveys, we find that ~75% of IR-selected AGNs are also identified as X-ray AGNs. This fraction increases to ~90% when comparing against the deepest X-ray data, indicating that at most ~10% of IR-selected AGNs may be heavily obscured. The IR-AGN selection proposed by Stern et al. suffers from contamination by star-forming galaxies at various redshifts when using deeper IR data, though the selection technique works well for shallow IR data. While similar overall, the IR-AGN samples preferentially contain more luminous AGNs, while the X-ray AGN samples identify a wider range of AGN accretion rates including low specific accretion rate AGNs, where the host galaxy light dominates at IR wavelengths. The host galaxy populations of the IR and X-ray AGN samples have similar rest-frame colors and stellar masses; both selections identify AGNs in blue, star-forming and red, quiescent galaxies.},

@article{Symeonidis:2013fe,
  abstract = {Using Herschel data from the deepest SPIRE and PACS surveys (HerMES and PEP) in COSMOS, GOODS-S and GOODS-N, we examine the dust properties of infrared (IR)-luminous (LIR > 1010 L&sun;) galaxies at 0.1 < z < 2 and determine how these evolve with cosmic time. The unique angle of this work is the rigorous analysis of survey selection effects, making this the first study of the star-formation-dominated, IR-luminous population within a framework almost entirely free of selection biases. We find that IR-luminous galaxies have spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with broad far-IR peaks characterized by cool/extended dust emission and average dust temperatures in the 25-45 K range. Hot (T > 45 K) SEDs and cold (T < 25 K), cirrus-dominated SEDs are rare, with most sources being within the range occupied by warm starbursts such as M82 and cool spirals such as M51. We observe a luminosity-temperature (L-T) relation, where the average dust temperature of log [LIR/L&sun;] ˜ 12.5 galaxies is about 10 K higher than that of their log [LIR/L&sun;] ˜ 10.5 counterparts. However, although the increased dust heating in more luminous systems is the driving factor behind the L-T relation, the increase in dust mass and/or starburst size with luminosity plays a dominant role in shaping it. Our results show that the dust conditions in IR-luminous sources evolve with cosmic time: at high redshift, dust temperatures are on average up to 10 K lower than what is measured locally (z ≲ 0.1). This is manifested as a flattening of the L-T relation, suggesting that (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies [(U)LIRGs] in the early Universe are typically characterized by a more extended dust distribution and/or higher dust masses than local equivalent sources. Interestingly, the evolution in dust temperature is luminosity dependent, with the fraction of LIRGs with T < 35 K showing a two-fold increase from z ˜ 0 to z ˜ 2, whereas that of ULIRGs with T < 35 K shows a six-fold increase. Our results suggest a greater diversity in the IR-luminous population at high redshift, particularly for ULIRGs.},

  abstract = {When combined with infrared observations with the Spitzer telescope (3 to 160 mum), the Herschel Space Observatory now fully samples the thermal dust emission up to 500 mum and enables us to better estimate the total infrared-submm energy budget (LTIR) of nearby galaxies. We present new empirical calibrations to estimate resolved and integrated total infrared luminosities from Spitzer and Herschel bands used as monochromatic or combined tracers. We base our calibrations on resolved elements of nearby galaxies (3 to 30 Mpc) observed with Herschel. We perform a resolved spectral energy distribution (SED) modelling of these objects using the Draine & Li dust models and investigate the influence of the addition of Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) measurements in the estimation of LTIR. We find that using data up to 250 mum leads to local LTIR values consistent with those obtained with a complete coverage (up to 500 mum) within $\pm$10 per cent for most of our resolved elements. We then study the distribution of energy in the resolved SEDs of our galaxies. The bulk of energy (30-50 per cent) is contained in the [70-160 mum] band. The [24-70 mum] fraction decreases with increasing metallicity. The [160-1100 mum]submillimetre band can account for up to 25 per cent of the LTIR in metal-rich galaxies. We investigate the correlation between the total infrared (TIR) surface brightnesses/luminosities and monochromatic Spitzer and Herschel surface brightnesses/luminosities. The three Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) bands can be used as reliable monochromatic estimators of the LTIR, the 100 mum band being the most reliable monochromatic tracer. There is also a strong correlation between the SPIRE 250 mum and LTIR, although with more scatter than for the PACS relations. We also study the ability of our monochromatic relations to reproduce integrated LTIR of nearby galaxies as well as LTIR of z ˜ 1-3 sources. Finally, we provide calibration coefficients that can be used to derive TIR surface brightnesses/luminosities from a combination of Spitzer and Herschel surface brightnesses/fluxes and analyse the associated uncertainties.},

@article{Rodriguez-Zaurin:2013if,
  abstract = {We present an optical spectroscopic study of a 90 per cent complete sample of nearby ULIRGs (z < 0.175) with optical Seyfert nuclei, with the aim of investigating the nature of the near-nuclear (r ≲ 3.5 kpc) warm gas outflows. A high proportion (94 per cent) of our sample show disturbed emission line kinematics in the form of broad (FWHM > 500 km s-1) and/or strongly blueshifted (DeltaV < -150 km s-1) emission line components. This proportion is significantly higher than found in a comparison sample of nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) that lack optical Seyfert nuclei (19 per cent). We also find evidence that the emission line kinematics of the Sy-ULIRGs are more highly disturbed than those of samples of non-ULIRG Seyferts and Palomar-Green quasars in the sense that, on average, their [O III] lambdalambda5007, 4959 emission lines are broader and more asymmetric.  The Sy-ULIRG sample encompasses a wide diversity of emission line profiles. In most individual objects, we are able to fit the profiles of all the emission lines of different ionization with a kinematic model derived from the strong [O III] lambdalambda4959, 5007 lines, using between two and five Gaussian components. From these fits, we derive diagnostic line ratios that are used to investigate the ionization mechanisms for the different kinematic components. We show that, in general, the line ratios are consistent with gas of supersolar abundance photoionized by a combination of AGN and starburst activity, with an increasing contribution from the AGN with increasing FWHM of the individual kinematic components, and the AGN contribution dominating for the broadest components. However, shock ionization cannot be ruled out in some cases. Our derived upper limits on the mass outflows rates and kinetic powers of the emission line outflows show that they can be as energetically significant as the neutral and molecular outflows in ULIRGs - consistent with the requirements of the hydrodynamic simulations that include AGN feedback. However, the uncertainties are large, and more accurate estimates of the radii, densities and reddening of the outflows are required to put these results on a firmer footing.},

By combining the Spitzer and SDSS data with the Two Micron All Sky Survey, we are able to construct a statistically robust rest-frame 0.1-100 mum type 1 quasar template. We find that the quasar population is well-described by a single power-law SED at wavelengths less than 20 mum, in good agreement with previous work. However, at longer wavelengths, we find a significant excess in infrared luminosity above an extrapolated power-law, along with significant object-to-object dispersion in the SED. The mean excess reaches a maximum of 0.8 dex at rest-frame wavelengths near 100 mum.},

@article{Bonsor:2013ix,
  abstract = {We present Herschel spatially resolved images of the debris disc orbiting the subgiant kappa Coronae Borealis (kappa CrB). Not only are these the first resolved images of a debris disc orbiting a subgiant, but kappa CrB is a rare example of an intermediate mass star where a detailed study of the structure of the planetary system can be made, including both planets and planetesimal belt(s). The only way to discover planets using the radial velocity technique around such stars is to observe `retired' A stars, which are cooler and slower rotators compared to their main-sequence counterparts. A planetary companion has already been detected orbiting the subgiant kappa CrB, with revised parameters of msin i = 2.1 MJ and apl = 2.8 au (Johnson et al. 2008). We present additional Keck I HIRES (High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer) radial velocity measurements that provide evidence for a second planetary companion, alongside Keck II adaptive optics imaging that places an upper limit on the mass of this companion. Modelling of our Herschel images shows that the dust is broadly distributed, but cannot distinguish between a single wide belt (from 20 to 220 au) or two narrow dust belts (at around 40 and 165 au). Given the existence of a second planetary companion beyond ˜3 au it is possible that the absence of dust within ˜20 au is caused by dynamical depletion, although the observations are not inconsistent with depletion of these regions by collisional erosion, which occurs at higher rates closer to the star.},

  abstract = {We present results from the deepest Herschel-Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) far-infrared blank field extragalactic survey, obtained by combining observations of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields from the PACS Evolutionary Probe (PEP) and GOODS-Herschel key programmes. We describe data reduction and theconstruction of images and catalogues. In the deepest parts of the GOODS-S field, the catalogues reach 3sigma depths of 0.9, 0.6 and 1.3 mJy at 70, 100 and 160 mum, respectively, and resolve ~75% of the cosmic infrared background at 100 mum and 160 mum into individually detected sources. We use these data to estimate the PACS confusion noise, to derive the PACS number counts down to unprecedented depths, and to determine the infrared luminosity function of galaxies down to LIR = 1011 L&sun; at z ~ 1 and LIR = 1012 L&sun; at z ~ 2, respectively. For the infrared luminosity function of galaxies, our deep Herschel far-infrared observations are fundamental because they provide more accurate infrared luminosity estimates than those previously obtained from mid-infrared observations. Maps and source catalogues (>3sigma) are now publicly released. Combined with the large wealth of multi-wavelength data available for the GOODS fields, these data provide a powerful new tool for studying galaxy evolution over a broad range of redshifts.  Based on observations carried out by the Herschel Space Observatory. Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.Appendix A is available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

@article{Snyder:2013ao,
  abstract = {We analyze the link between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and mid-infrared flux using dust radiative transfer calculations of starbursts realized in hydrodynamical simulations. Focusing on the effects of galaxy dust, we evaluate diagnostics commonly used to disentangle AGN and star formation in ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs). We examine these quantities as a function of time, viewing angle, dust model, AGN spectrum, and AGN strength in merger simulations representing two possible extremes of the ULIRG population: one is a typical gas-rich merger at z ~ 0, and the other is characteristic of extremely obscured starbursts at z ~ 2-4. This highly obscured burst begins star-formation-dominated with significant polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, and ends with a ~109 yr period of red near-IR colors. At coalescence, when the AGN is most luminous, dust obscures the near-infrared AGN signature, reduces the relative emission from PAHs, and enhances the 9.7 mum absorption by silicate grains. Although generally consistent with previous interpretations, our results imply none of these indicators can unambiguously estimate the AGN luminosity fraction in all cases. Motivated by the simulations, we show that a combination of the extinction feature at 9.7 mum, the PAH strength, and a near-infrared slope can simultaneously constrain the AGN fraction and dust grain distribution for a wide range of obscuration. We find that this indicator, accessible to the James Webb Space Telescope, may estimate the AGN power as tightly as the hard X-ray flux alone, thereby providing a valuable future cross-check and constraint for large samples of distant ULIRGs.},

@article{Leipski:2013wq,
  abstract = {We present Herschel far-infrared (FIR) photometry of 11 quasars at redshift z > 5 that have previously been detected at 1.2 mm. We perform full spectral energy distribution (SED) fits over the wavelength range lambdarest ~ 0.1-400 mum for those objects with good Herschel detections. These fits reveal the need for an additional FIR component besides the emission from a dusty active galactic nucleus (AGN)-powered torus. This additional FIR component has temperatures of T FIR ~ 40-60 K with luminosities of L 8-1000 mum ~ 1013 L &sun; (accounting for 25%-60% of the bolometric FIR luminosity). If the FIR dust emission is due to star formation it would suggest star formation rates in excess of 1000 solar masses per year. We show that at long wavelengths (lambdarest >~ 50 mum) the contribution of the AGN-powered torus emission is negligible. This explains how previous FIR studies of high-redshift quasars that relied on single-component fits to (ground-based) observations at lambdaobs >~ 350 mum reached T FIR and L FIR values similar to our complete SED fits. Stacking the Herschel data of four individually undetected sources reveals a significant average signal in the PACS bands but not in SPIRE. The average SED of sources with individual Herschel detections shows a striking surplus in near- and mid-infrared (MIR) emission when compared to common AGN templates. The comparison between two average SEDs (sources with and without individual Herschel detections) matched in the UV/optical indicates that for these objects the strength of the MIR emission may correlate with the strength of the FIR emission.},

  abstract = {Pressure-regulated star formation is a simple variant on the usual supernova-regulated star formation efficiency that controls the global star formation rate as a function of cold gas content in star-forming galaxies, and accounts for the Schmidt-Kennicutt law in both nearby and distant galaxies. Inclusion of active galactic nucleus (AGN) induced pressure, by jets and/or winds that flow back onto a gas-rich disk, can lead, under some circumstances, to significantly enhanced star formation rates, especially at high redshift and most likely followed by the more widely accepted phase of star formation quenching. Simple expressions are derived that relate supermassive black hole growth, star formation, and outflow rates. The ratios of black hole to spheroid mass and of both black hole accretion and outflow rates to star formation rate are predicted as a function of time. I suggest various tests of the AGN-triggered star formation hypothesis.},

@article{Zubovas:2013kk,
  abstract = {Recent well-resolved numerical simulations of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback have shown that its effects on the host galaxy may be not only negative but also positive. In the late gas-poor phase, AGN feedback blows the gas away and terminates star formation. However, in the gas-rich phase(s), AGN outflows trigger star formation by over-compressing cold dense gas and thus provide positive feedback on their hosts. In this paper we study this AGN-triggered starburst effect. We show that star formation rate in the burst increases until the star formation feedback counteracts locally the AGN outflow compression. Globally, this predicts a strong nearly linear statistical correlation between the AGN and starburst bolometric luminosities in disc galaxies, L* ≅ LAGN5/6. The correlation is statistical only because AGN activity may fluctuate on short time-scales (as short as tens of years), and because AGN may turn off but its effects on the host may continue to last until the AGN-driven outflow leaves the host, which may be up to 10 times longer than the duration of the AGN activity. The coefficient in front of this relation depends on the clumpiness and morphology of the cold gas in the galaxy. A `maximum starburst' takes place in an azimuthally uniform gas disc, for which we derive an upper limit of L* ˜ 50 times larger than LAGN for typical quasars. For more clumpy and/or compact cold gas distributions, the starburst luminosity decreases. We also suggest that similar AGN-triggered starbursts are possible in hosts of all geometries, including during galaxy mergers, provided the AGN is activated. Finally, we note that due to the short duration of the AGN activity phase the accelerating influence of AGN on starbursts may be much more common than observations of simultaneous AGN and starbursts would suggest.},

  abstract = {We calculate the angular correlation function for a sample of ~170,000 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) extracted from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) catalog, selected to have red mid-IR colors (W1 - W2 > 0.8) and 4.6 mum flux densities brighter than 0.14 mJy). The sample is expected to be >90% reliable at identifying AGNs and to have a mean redshift of langzrang = 1.1. In total, the angular clustering of WISE AGNs is roughly similar to that of optical AGNs. We cross-match these objects with the photometric Sloan Digital Sky Survey catalog and distinguish obscured sources with r - W2 > 6 from bluer, unobscured AGNs. Obscured sources present a higher clustering signal than unobscured sources. Since the host galaxy morphologies of obscured AGNs are not typical red sequence elliptical galaxies and show disks in many cases, it is unlikely that the increased clustering strength of the obscured population is driven by a host galaxy segregation bias. By using relatively complete redshift distributions from the COSMOS survey, we find that obscured sources at langzrang ~ 0.9 have a bias of b = 2.9 $\pm$ 0.6 and are hosted in dark matter halos with a typical mass of log (M/M &sun; h -1) ~ 13.5. In contrast, unobscured AGNs at langzrang ~ 1.1 have a bias of b = 1.6 $\pm$ 0.6 and inhabit halos of log (M/M &sun; h -1) ~ 12.4. These findings suggest that obscured AGNs inhabit denser environments than unobscured AGNs, and they are difficult to reconcile with the simplest AGN unification models, where obscuration is driven solely by orientation.},

  abstract = {We study the mid- to far-IR properties of a 24 mum-selected flux-limited sample (S24> 5 mJy) of 154 intermediate redshift (< z > ~ 0.15), infrared luminous galaxies, drawn from the 5 Milli-Jansky Unbiased Spitzer Extragalactic Survey. By combining existing mid-IR spectroscopy and new Herschel SPIRE submm photometry from the Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey, we derived robust total infrared luminosity (LIR) and dust mass (Mdust) estimates and infered the relative contribution of the AGN to the infrared energy budget of the sources. We found that the total (8-1000 mum) infrared emission of galaxies with weak 6.2 mum PAH emission (EW6.2 <= 0.2 mum) is dominated by AGN activity, while for galaxies with EW6.2> 0.2 mum more than 50% of the LIR arises from star formation. We also found that for galaxies detected in the 250-500 mum Herschel bands an AGN has a statistically insignificant effect on the temperature of the cold dust and the far-IR colours of the host galaxy, which are primarily shaped by star formation activity. For star-forming galaxies we reveal an anti-correlation between the LIR-to-rest-frame 8 mum luminosity ratio, IR8 ≡ LIR/L8 and the strength of PAH features. We found that this anti-correlation is primarily driven by variations in the PAHsemission, and not by variations in the 5-15 mum mid-IR continuum emission. Using the [Ne iii]/[Ne ii] line ratio as a tracer of the hardness of the radiation field, we confirm that galaxies with harder radiation fields tend to exhibit weaker PAH features, and found that they have higher IR8 values and higher dust-mass-weighted luminosities (LIR/Mdust), the latter being a proxy for the dust temperature (Td). We argue that these trends originate either from variations in the environment of the star-forming regions or are caused by variations in the age of the starburst. Finally, we provide scaling relations that will allow estimating LIR, based on single-band observations with the mid-infrared instrument, on board the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.

  abstract = {We present an extension of the code ProDiMo that allows for a modeling of processes pertinent to active galactic nuclei and to an ambient chemistry that is time dependent. We present a proof-of-concept and focus on a few astrophysically relevant species, e.g., H+, H2+, and H3+; C+ and N+; C and O; CO and H2O; OH+, H2O+, and H3O+; and HCN and HCO+. We find that the freeze-out of water is strongly suppressed and that this affects the bulk of the oxygen and carbon chemistry occurring in the active galactic nucleus (AGN). The commonly used AGN tracer HCN/HCO+ is strongly time-dependent, with ratios that vary over orders of magnitude for times longer than 104 years. Through Atacama large millimeter array observations this ratio can be used to probe how the narrow-line region evolves under large fluctuations in the supermassive black hole accretion rate. Strong evolutionary trends, on time scales of 104-108 years are also found in species such as H3O+, CO, and H2O. These reflect, respectively, time-dependent effects in the  ionization balance, the transient nature of the production of molecular gas,  and the freeze-out/sublimation of water.},

@article{Asmus:2014ad,
  abstract = {We present the first subarcsecond-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) atlas of local active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our atlas contains 253 AGN with a median redshift of z = 0.016, and includes all publicly available MIR imaging performed to date with ground-based 8-m class telescopes, a total of 895 independent measurements. Of these, more than 60 per cent are published here for the first time. We detect extended nuclear emission in at least 21 per cent of the objects, while another 19 per cent appear clearly point-like, and the remaining objects cannot be constrained. Where present, elongated nuclear emission aligns with the ionization cones in Seyferts. Subarcsecond resolution allows us to isolate the AGN emission on scales of a few tens of parsecs and to obtain nuclear photometry in multiple filters for the objects. Median spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for the different optical AGN types are constructed and individual MIR 12 and 18 mum continuum luminosities are computed. These range over more than six orders of magnitude. In comparison to the arcsecond-scale MIR emission as probed by Spitzer, the continuum emission is much lower on subarcsecond scales in many cases. The silicate feature strength is similar on both scales and generally appears in emission (absorption) in type I (II) AGN. However, the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission appears weaker or absent on subarcsecond scales. The differences of the MIR SEDs on both scales are particularly large for AGN/starburst composites and close-by (and weak) AGN. The nucleus dominates over the total emission of the galaxy only at luminosities ≳1044 erg s-1. The AGN MIR atlas is well suited not only for detailed investigation of individual sources but also for statistical studies of AGN unification.},

  abstract = {Recent theoretical and observational works indicate the presence of a correlation between the star-formation rate (SFR) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) luminosity (and, therefore, the black hole accretion rate, \dot{M}_BH) of Seyfert galaxies. This suggests a physical connection between the gas-forming stars on kpc scales and the gas on sub-pc scales that is feeding the black hole. We compiled the largest sample of Seyfert galaxies to date with high angular resolution (~0.''4-0.''8) mid-infrared (8-13 mum) spectroscopy. The sample includes 29 Seyfert galaxies drawn from the AGN Revised Shapley-Ames catalog. At a median distance of 33 Mpc, our data allow us to probe nuclear regions on scales of ~65 pc (median value). We found no general evidence of suppression of the 11.3 mum polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission in the vicinity of these AGN, and we used this feature as a proxy for the SFR. We detected the 11.3 mum PAH feature in the nuclear spectra of 45% of our sample. The derived nuclear SFRs are, on average, five times lower than those measured in circumnuclear regions of 600 pc in size (median value). However, the projected nuclear SFR densities (median value of 22 M &sun; yr-1 kpc-2) are a factor of 20 higher than those measured on circumnuclear scales. This indicates that the SF activity per unit area in the central ~65 pc region of Seyfert galaxies is much higher than at larger distances from their nuclei. We studied the connection between the nuclear SFR and \dot{M}_BH and showed that numerical simulations reproduce our observed relation fairly well.},

@article{Forster-Schreiber:2014yf,
  abstract = {We report the detection of ubiquitous powerful nuclear outflows in massive (>=1011 M &sun;) z ~ 2 star-forming galaxies (SFGs), which are plausibly driven by an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The sample consists of the eight most massive SFGs from our SINS/zC-SINF survey of galaxy kinematics with the imaging spectrometer SINFONI, six of which have sensitive high-resolution adaptive optics-assisted observations. All of the objects are disks hosting a significant stellar bulge. The spectra in their central regions exhibit a broad component in Halpha and forbidden [N II] and [S II] line emission, with typical velocity FWHM ~ 1500 km s-1, [N II]/Halpha ratio ≈ 0.6, and intrinsic extent of 2-3 kpc. These properties are consistent with warm ionized gas outflows associated with Type 2 AGN, the presence of which is confirmed via independent diagnostics in half the galaxies. The data imply a median ionized gas mass outflow rate of ~60 M &sun; yr-1 and mass loading of ~3. At larger radii, a weaker broad component is detected but with lower FWHM ~485 km s-1 and [N II]/Halpha ≈ 0.35, characteristic for star formation-driven outflows as found in the lower-mass SINS/zC-SINF galaxies. The high inferred mass outflow rates and frequent occurrence suggest that the nuclear outflows efficiently expel gas out of the centers of the galaxies with high duty cycles and may thus contribute to the process of star formation quenching in massive galaxies. Larger samples at high masses will be crucial in confirming the importance and energetics of the nuclear outflow phenomenon and its connection to AGN activity and bulge growth.

  abstract = {We study the evolution of the dust temperature of galaxies in the SFR- M* plane up to z ~ 2 using far-infrared and submillimetre observations from the Herschel Space Observatory taken as part of the PACS Evolutionary Probe (PEP) and Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey (HerMES) guaranteed time key programmes. Starting from a sample of galaxies with reliable star-formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses (M*) and redshift estimates, we grid the SFR- M*parameter space in several redshift ranges and estimate the mean dust temperature (Tdust) of each SFR-M* - z bin. Dust temperatures are inferred using the stacked far-infrared flux densities (100-500 mum) of our SFR-M* - z bins. At all redshifts, the dust temperature of galaxies smoothly increases with rest-frame infrared luminosities (LIR), specific SFRs (SSFR; i.e., SFR/M*), and distances with respect to the main sequence (MS) of the SFR- M* plane (i.e., Deltalog (SSFR)MS = log [SSFR(galaxy)/SSFRMS(M*,z)]). The Tdust - SSFR and Tdust - Deltalog (SSFR)MS correlations are statistically much more significant than the Tdust - LIR one. While the slopes of these three correlations are redshift-independent, their normalisations evolve smoothly from z = 0 and z ~ 2. We convert these results into a recipe to derive Tdust from SFR, M* and z, valid out to z ~ 2 and for the stellar mass and SFR range covered by our stacking analysis. The existence of a strong Tdust - Deltalog (SSFR)MS correlation provides us with several pieces of information on the dust and gas content of galaxies. Firstly, the slope of the Tdust - Deltalog (SSFR)MS correlation can be explained by the increase in the star-formation efficiency (SFE; SFR/Mgas) with Deltalog (SSFR)MS as found locally by molecular gas studies. Secondly, at fixed Deltalog (SSFR)MS, the constant dust temperature observed in galaxies probing wide ranges in SFR and M* can be explained by an increase or decrease in the number of star-forming regions with comparable SFE enclosed in them. And thirdly, at high redshift, the normalisation towards hotter dust temperature of the Tdust - Deltalog (SSFR)MS correlation can be explained by the decrease in the metallicities of galaxies or by the increase in the SFE of MS galaxies. All these results support the hypothesis that the conditions prevailing in the star-forming regions of MS and far-above-MS galaxies are different. MS galaxies have star-forming regions with low SFEs and thus cold dust, while galaxies situated far above the MS seem to be in a starbursting phase characterised by star-forming regions with high SFEs and thus hot dust.

@article{Hopkins:2014hb,
  abstract = {Recent observations have indicated that a large fraction of the low- to intermediate-luminosity AGN population lives in disc-dominated hosts, while the more luminous quasars live in bulge-dominated hosts (that may or may not be major merger remnants), in conflict with some previous model predictions. We therefore build and compare a semi-empirical model for AGN fuelling which accounts for both merger and non-merger `triggering'. In particular, we show that the `stochastic accretion' model - in which fuelling in disc galaxies is essentially a random process arising whenever dense gas clouds reach the nucleus - provides a good match to the present observations at low/intermediate luminosities. However, it falls short of the high-luminosity population. We combine this with models for major merger-induced AGN fueling, which lead to rarer but more luminous events, and predict the resulting abundance of disc-dominated and bulge-dominated AGN host galaxies as a function of luminosity and redshift. We compile and compare observational constraints from z ˜ 0 to 2. The models and observations generically show a transition from disc to bulge dominance in hosts near the Seyfert-quasar transition, at all redshifts. `Stochastic' fuelling dominates AGN by number (dominant at low luminosity), and dominates black hole (BH) growth below the `knee' in the present-day BH mass function ( ≲ 107 M&sun;). However, it accounts for just ˜10 per cent of BH mass growth at masses ≳ 108 M&sun;. In total, fuelling in discy hosts accounts for ˜30 per cent of the total AGN luminosity density/BH mass density. The combined model also accurately predicts the AGN luminosity function and clustering/bias as a function of luminosity and redshift; however, we argue that these are not sensitive probes of BH fuelling mechanisms.},

@article{Nayakshin:2014jt,
  abstract = {We study effects of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback outflows on multiphase inter stellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. We argue that supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth is dominated by accretion of dense cold clumps and filaments. AGN feedback outflows overtake the cold medium, compress it, and trigger a powerful starburst - a positive AGN feedback. This predicts a statistical correlation between AGN luminosity and star formation rate at high luminosities. Most of the outflow's kinetic energy escapes from the bulge via low-density voids. The cold phase is pushed outward only by the ram pressure (momentum) of the outflow. The combination of the negative and positive forms of AGN feedback leads to an M-sigma relation similar to the result of King. Due to porosity of cold ISM in the bulge, SMBH influence on the low density medium of the host galaxy is significant even for SMBH well below the M-sigma mass. The role of SMBH feedback in our model evolves in space and time with the ISM structure. In the early gas rich phase, SMBH accelerates star formation in the bulge. During later gas poor (red-and-dead) phases, SMBH feedback is mostly negative everywhere due to scarcity of the cold ISM.},

@article{Young:2014pi,
  abstract = {We present a study of the morphology and intensity of star formation in the host galaxies of eight Palomar-Green quasars using observations with the Hubble Space Telescope. Our observations are motivated by recent evidence for a close relationship between black hole growth and the stellar mass evolution in its host galaxy. We use narrow-band [O II]lambda3727, Hbeta, [O III]lambda5007 and Paalpha images, taken with the Wide Field Planetary Camera 2 and NICMOS instruments, to map the morphology of line-emitting regions, and, after extinction corrections, diagnose the excitation mechanism and infer star-formation rates. Significant challenges in this type of work are the separation of the quasar light from the stellar continuum and the quasar-excited gas from the star-forming regions. To this end, we present a novel technique for image decomposition and subtraction of quasar light. Our primary result is the detection of extended line-emitting regions with sizes ranging from 0.5 to 5 kpc and distributed symmetrically around the nucleus, powered primarily by star formation. We determine star-formation rates of the order of a few tens of M&sun; yr-1. The host galaxies of our target quasars have stellar masses of the order of 1011 M&sun; and specific star-formation rates on a par with those of M82 and luminous infrared galaxies. As such they fall at the upper envelope or just above the star-formation mass sequence in the specific star formation versus stellar mass diagram. We see a clear trend of increasing star-formation rate with quasar luminosity, reinforcing the link between the growth of the stellar mass of the host and the black hole mass found by other authors.},

@article{Honig:2014cs,
  abstract = {X-ray surveys have revealed a new class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) with a very low observed fraction of scattered soft X-rays, fscat <0.5 per cent. Based on X-ray modelling, these `X-ray new-type', or low observed X-ray-scattering (hereafter, `low-scattering') sources have been interpreted as deeply buried AGN with a high covering factor of gas. In this paper, we address the questions whether the host galaxies of low-scattering AGN may contribute to the observed X-ray properties, and whether we can find any direct evidence for high covering factors from the infrared (IR) emission. We find that X-ray low-scattering AGN are preferentially hosted by highly inclined galaxies or merger systems as compared to other Seyfert galaxies, increasing the likelihood that the line of sight towards the AGN intersects with high columns of host-galactic gas and dust. Moreover, while a detailed analysis of the IR emission of low-scattering AGN ESO 103-G35 remains inconclusive, we do not find any indication of systematically higher dust covering factors in a sample of low-scattering AGN based on their IR emission. For ESO 103-G35, we constrained the temperature, mass and location of the IR emitting dust which is consistent with expectations for the dusty torus. However, a deep silicate absorption feature probably from much cooler dust suggests an additional screen absorber on larger scales within the host galaxy. Taking these findings together, we propose that the low fscat observed in low-scattering AGN is not necessarily the result of circumnuclear dust but could originate from interference of host-galactic gas with a column density of the order of 1022 cm-2 with the line of sight. We discuss implications of this hypothesis for X-ray models, high-ionization emission lines and observed star formation activity in these objects.},

  abstract = {The relationship between galaxies of intermediate stellar mass and moderate luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at 1 < z < 3 is investigated with a Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS) sample complemented with public data in the GOODS-South field. Using X-ray data, hidden AGNs are identified in unsuspected star-forming galaxies with no apparent signs of non-stellar activity. In the color-mass plane, two parallel trends emerge during the ~2 Gyr between the average redshifts z ~ 2.2 and z ~ 1.3: while the red sequence becomes significantly more populated by ellipticals, the majority of AGNs with L(2-10 keV) > 1042.3 erg s-1 disappear from the blue cloud/green valley where they were hosted predominantly by star-forming systems with disk and irregular morphologies. These results are even clearer when the rest-frame colors are corrected for dust reddening. At z ~ 2.2, the ultraviolet spectra of active galaxies (including two Type 1 AGNs) show possible gas outflows with velocities up to about -500 km s-1, which are observed neither in inactive systems at the same redshift, nor at lower redshifts. Such outflows indicate the presence of gas that can move faster than the escape velocities of active galaxies. These results suggest that feedback from moderately luminous AGNs (log LX < 44.5 erg s-1) played a key role at z >~ 2 by contributing to outflows capable of ejecting part of the interstellar medium and leading to a rapid decrease in star formation in host galaxies with stellar masses 10 < log({\cal M}/M_{\odot }) 11.},

@article{Barro:2014it,
  abstract = {We analyze the star-forming and structural properties of 45 massive (log(M/M &sun;) >10) compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 2 < z < 3 to explore whether they are progenitors of compact quiescent galaxies at z ~ 2. The optical/NIR and far-IR Spitzer/Herschel colors indicate that most compact SFGs are heavily obscured. Nearly half (47%) host an X-ray-bright active galactic nucleus (AGN). In contrast, only about 10% of other massive galaxies at that time host AGNs. Compact SFGs have centrally concentrated light profiles and spheroidal morphologies similar to quiescent galaxies and are thus strikingly different from other SFGs, which typically are disk-like and sometimes clumpy or irregular. Most compact SFGs lie either within the star formation rate (SFR)-mass main sequence (65%) or below it (30%), on the expected evolutionary path toward quiescent galaxies. These results show conclusively that galaxies become more compact before they lose their gas and dust, quenching star formation. Using extensive HST photometry from CANDELS and grism spectroscopy from the 3D-HST survey, we model their stellar populations with either exponentially declining (tau) star formation histories (SFHs) or physically motivated SFHs drawn from semianalytic models (SAMs). SAMs predict longer formation timescales and older ages ~2 Gyr, which are nearly twice as old as the estimates of the tau models. Both models yield good spectral energy distribution fits, indicating that the systematic uncertainty in the age due to degeneracies in the SFH is of that order of magnitude. However, SAM SFHs better match the observed slope and zero point of the SFR-mass main sequence. Contrary to expectations, some low-mass compact SFGs (log(M/M &sun;) =10-10.6) have younger ages but lower specific SFRs than that of more massive galaxies, suggesting that the low-mass galaxies reach the red sequence faster. If the progenitors of compact SFGs are extended SFGs, state-of-the-art SAMs show that mergers and disk instabilities (DIs) are both able to shrink galaxies, but DIs are more frequent (60% versus 40%) and form more concentrated galaxies. We confirm this result via high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations.},

@article{Gan:2014ek,
  abstract = {Based on two-dimensional high-resolution hydrodynamic numerical simulation, we study the mechanical and radiative feedback effects from the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) on the cosmological evolution of an isolated elliptical galaxy. The inner boundary of the simulation domain is carefully chosen so that the fiducial Bondi radius is resolved and the accretion rate of the black hole is determined self-consistently. It is well known that when the accretion rates are high and low, the central AGNs will be in cold and hot accretion modes, which correspond to the radiative and kinetic feedback modes, respectively. The emitted spectrum from the hot accretion flows is harder than that from the cold accretion flows, which could result in a higher Compton temperature accompanied by a more efficient radiative heating, according to previous theoretical works. Such a difference of the Compton temperature between the two feedback modes, the focus of this study, has been neglected in previous works. Significant differences in the kinetic feedback mode are found as a result of the stronger Compton heating. More importantly, if we constrain models to correctly predict black hole growth and AGN duty cycle after cosmological evolution, we find that the favored model parameters are constrained: mechanical feedback efficiency diminishes with decreasing luminosity (the maximum efficiency being ~= 10-3.5), and X-ray Compton temperature increases with decreasing luminosity, although models with fixed mechanical efficiency and Compton temperature can be found that are satisfactory as well. We conclude that radiative feedback in the kinetic mode is much more important than previously thought.},

  abstract = {We present Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 mum integrated photometry for the 323 galaxies in the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS), a K-band, volume-limited sample of galaxies in the local Universe. Once combined with the Herschel/SPIRE observations already available, these data make the HRS the largest representative sample of nearby galaxies with homogeneous coverage across the 100-500 mum wavelength range. In this paper, we take advantage of this unique data set to investigate the properties and shape of the far-infrared/submillimetre spectral energy distribution in nearby galaxies. We show that, in the stellar mass range covered by the HRS (8 ≲ log (M*/M&sun;) ≲ 12), the far-infrared/submillimetre colours are inconsistent with a single modified blackbody having the same dust emissivity index beta for all galaxies. In particular, either beta decreases or multiple temperature components are needed, when moving from metal-rich/gas-poor to metal-poor/gas-rich galaxies. We thus investigate how the dust temperature and mass obtained from a single modified blackbody depend on the assumptions made on beta. We show that, while the correlations between dust temperature, galaxy structure and star formation rate are strongly model dependent, the dust mass scaling relations are much more reliable, and variations of beta only change the strength of the observed trends.},

@article{Ciesla:2014uo,
  abstract = {Although it accounts only for a small fraction of the baryonic mass, dust has a profound impact on the physical processes at play in galaxies. Thus, to understand the evolution of galaxies, it is essential not only to characterize dust properties per se, but also in relation to global galaxy properties. To do so, we derive the dust properties of galaxies in a volume limited, K-band selected sample, the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS). We gather infrared photometric data from 8 mum to 500 mum from Spitzer, WISE, IRAS, and Herschel for all of the HRS galaxies. Draine & Li (2007, ApJ, 663, 866) models are fit to the data from which the stellar contribution has been carefully removed. We find that our photometric coverage is sufficient to constrain all of the parameters of the Draine & Li models and that a strong constraint on the 20-60 mum range is mandatory to estimate the relative contribution of the photo-dissociation regions to the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED). The SED models tend to systematically underestimate the observed 500 mum flux densities, especially for low-mass systems. We provide the output parameters for all of the galaxies, i.e., the minimum intensity of the interstellar radiation field, the fraction of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH), the relative contribution of PDR and evolved stellar population to the dust heating, the dust mass, and the infrared luminosity. For a subsample of gas-rich galaxies, we analyze the relations between these parameters and the main integrated properties of galaxies, such as stellar mass, star formation rate, infraredluminosity, metallicity, Halpha and H-band surface brightness, and the far-ultraviolet attenuation. A good correlation between the fraction of PAH and the metallicity is found, implying a weakening of the PAH emission in galaxies with low metallicities and, thus, low stellar masses. The intensity of the diffuse interstellar radiation field and the H-band and Halpha surface brightnesses are correlated, suggesting that the diffuse dust component is heated by both the young stars in star-forming regions and the diffuse evolved population. We use these results to provide a new set of infrared templates calibrated with Herschel observations on nearby galaxies and a mean SED template to provide the z = 0 reference for cosmological studies. For the same purpose, we place our sample on the SFR - M* diagram. The templates are compared to the most popular infrared SED libraries, enlightening a large discrepancy between all of them in the 20-100 mum range.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.Table 4 and appendices are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.org},

  abstract = {We present integral field unit observations covering the [O III]lambdalambda4959, 5007 and Hbeta emission lines of 16 z < 0.2 type 2 active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our targets are selected from a well-constrained parent sample of ≈24 000 AGN so that we can place our observations into the context of the overall AGN population. Our targets are radio quiet with star formation rates (SFRs; ≲[10-100] M&sun; yr-1) that are consistent with normal star-forming galaxies. We decouple the kinematics of galaxy dynamics and mergers from outflows. We find high-velocity ionized gas (velocity widths ≈600-1500 km s-1; maximum velocities <=1700 km s-1) with observed spatial extents of ≳(6-16) kpc in all targets and observe signatures of spherical outflows and bi-polar superbubbles. We show that our targets are representative of z < 0.2, luminous (i.e. L[O III] > 1041.7 erg s-1) type 2 AGN and that ionized outflows are not only common but also in >=70 per cent (3sigma confidence) of cases, they are extended over kiloparsec scales. Our study demonstrates that galaxy-wide energetic outflows are not confined to the most extreme star-forming galaxies or radio-luminous AGN; however, there may be a higher incidence of the most extreme outflow velocities in quasars hosted in ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Both star formation and AGN activity appear to be energetically viable to drive the outflows and we find no definitive evidence that favours one process over the other. Although highly uncertain, we derive mass outflow rates (typically ≈10 times the SFRs), kinetic energies (≈0.5-10 per cent of LAGN) and momentum rates (typically ≳10-20 × LAGN/c) consistent with theoretical models that predict AGN-driven outflows play a significant role in shaping the evolution of galaxies.},

  abstract = {We study a hundred of galaxies from the spectroscopic Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with individual detections in the far-infrared Herschel Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer bands (100 or 160 mum) and in the GALEX far-ultraviolet band up to z ˜ 0.4 in the COSMOS and Lockman Hole fields. The galaxies are divided into four spectral and four morphological types. For the star-forming and unclassifiable galaxies, we calculate dust extinctions from the ultraviolet (UV) slope, the Halpha/Hbeta ratio and the LIR/LUV ratio. There is a tight correlation between the dust extinction and both LIR and metallicity. We calculate SFRtotal and compare it with other star formation rate (SFR) estimates (Halpha, UV, SDSS) finding very good agreement between them with smaller dispersions than typical SFR uncertainties. We study the effect of mass and metallicity, finding that it is only significant at high masses for SFRHalpha. For the AGN and composite galaxies, we find a tight correlation between SFR and LIR (sigma ˜ 0.29), while the dispersion in the SFR-LUV relation is larger (sigma ˜ 0.57). The galaxies follow the prescriptions of the Fundamental Plane in the M-Z-SFR space.},

  abstract = {We analyse the stellar populations in the host galaxies of 53 X-ray selected optically dull active galactic nuclei (AGN) at 0.34 < z < 1.07 with ultradeep (mAB = 26.5, 3sigma) optical medium-band (R ˜ 50) photometry from the Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources (SHARDS). The spectral resolution of SHARDS allows us to consistently measure the strength of the 4000 {\AA} break, Dn(4000), a reliable age indicator for stellar populations. We confirm that most X-ray selected moderate-luminosity AGN (LX < 1044 erg s-1) are hosted by massive galaxies (typically M* >1010.5 M&sun;) and that the observed fraction of galaxies hosting an AGN increases with the stellar mass. A careful selection of random control samples of inactive galaxies allows us to remove the stellar mass and redshift dependences of the AGN fraction to explore trends with several stellar age indicators. We find no significant differences in the distribution of the rest-frame U - V colour for AGN hosts and inactive galaxies, in agreement with previous results. However, we find significantly shallower 4000 {\AA} breaks in AGN hosts, indicative of younger stellar populations. With the help of a model-independent determination of the extinction, we obtain extinction-corrected U - V colours and light-weighted average stellar ages. We find that AGN hosts have younger stellar populations and higher extinction compared to inactive galaxies with the same stellar mass and at the same redshift. We find a highly significant excess of AGN hosts with Dn(4000) ˜ 1.4 and light-weighted average stellar ages of 300-500 Myr, as well as a deficit of AGN in intrinsic red galaxies. We interpret failure in recognizing these trends in previous studies as a consequence of the balancing effect in observed colours of the age-extinction degeneracy.},

@article{Speagle:2014rc,
  abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z ~ 6. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations (~0.1 dex 1sigma interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is ~0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 $\pm$ 0.02 - 0.026 $\pm$ 0.003 × t)log M * - (6.51 $\pm$ 0.24 - 0.11 $\pm$ 0.03 × t), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-tau models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a typical MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1sigma spread in formation times of ~1.4 Gyr.},

@article{Shi:2014qr,
  abstract = {As a step toward a comprehensive overview of the infrared (IR) diagnostics of the central engines and host galaxies of quasars at low redshift, we present Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopic (5-40 mum) and photometric (24, 70, and 160 mum) measurements of all Palomar-Green (PG) quasars at z < 0.5 and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) quasars at z < 0.3. We supplement these data with Herschel measurements at 160 mum. The sample is composed of 87 optically selected PG quasars and 52 near-IR-selected 2MASS quasars. Here we present the data, measure the prominent spectral features, and separate emission due to star formation from that emitted by the dusty circumnuclear torus. We find that the mid-IR (5-30 mum) spectral shape for the torus is largely independent of quasar IR luminosity with scatter in the spectral energy distribution (SED) shape of lsim0.2 dex. Except for the silicate features, no large difference is observed between PG (unobscured---silicate emission) and 2MASS (obscured---silicate absorption) quasars. Only mild silicate features are observed in both cases. When in emission, the peak wavelength of the silicate feature tends to be longer than 9.7 mum, possibly indicating effects on grain properties near the active galactic nucleus. The IR color is shown to correlate with the equivalent width of the aromatic features, indicating that the slope of the quasar mid- to far-IR SED is to first order driven by the fraction of radiation from star formation in the IR bands.},

@article{Schaye:2015hl,
  abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard Lambda cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲ 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 < M*/M&sun; ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M&sun; (M* ≳ 1010 M&sun; at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

@article{Trump:2015db,
  abstract = {We use 317,000 emission-line galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to investigate line-ratio selection of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). In particular, we demonstrate that star formation dilution by HII regions causes a significant bias against AGN selection in low-mass, blue, star-forming, disk-dominated galaxies. This bias is responsible for the observed preference of AGNs among high-mass, green, moderately star-forming, bulge-dominated hosts. We account for the bias and simulate the intrinsic population of emission-line AGNs using a physically-motivated Eddington ratio distribution, intrinsic AGN narrow line region line ratios, a luminosity-dependent Lbol/L[OIII] bolometric correction, and the observed Mbh-sigma relation. These simulations indicate that, in massive (log(M*/Msun) > 10) galaxies, AGN accretion is correlated with specific star formation rate but is otherwise uniform with stellar mass. There is some hint of lower black hole occupation in low-mass (log(M*/Msun) < 10) hosts, although our modeling is limited by uncertainties in measuring and interpreting the velocity dispersions of low-mass galaxies. The presence of star formation dilution means that AGNs contribute little to the observed strong optical emission lines (e.g., [OIII] and Ha) in low-mass and star-forming hosts. However the AGN population recovered by our modeling indicates that AGN feedback has nearly uniform efficiency at all stellar masses, star formation rates, and morphologies. Taken together, our characterization of the observational bias and resultant AGN occupation function suggest that AGNs are unlikely to be the dominant source of star formation quenching in galaxies, but instead are fueled by the same gas which drives star formation activity.},

The satellite was launched into a 900 km-altitude near-polar orbit, and its cryogenic helium supply was exhausted on November 22, 1983. By mission's end, 72 percent of the sky had been observed with three or more hours-confirming scans, and 95 percent with two or more hours-confirming scans. About 2000 stars detected at 12 and 25 microns early in the mission, and identified in the SAO (1966) catalog, have a positional uncertainty ellipse whose axes are 45 x 9 arcsec for an hours-confirmed source.},

  abstract = {We present the most up to date X-ray luminosity function (XLF) and absorption function of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) over the redshift range from 0 to 5, utilizing the largest, highly complete sample ever available obtained from surveys performed with Swift/BAT, MAXI, ASCA, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and ROSAT. The combined sample, including that of the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey, consists of 4039 detections in the soft (0.5-2 keV) and/or hard (>2 keV) band. We utilize a maximum likelihood method to reproduce the count rate versus redshift distribution for each survey, by taking into account the evolution of the absorbed fraction, the contribution from Compton-thick (CTK) AGNs, and broadband spectra of AGNs, including reflection components from tori based on the luminosity- and redshift-dependent unified scheme. We find that the shape of the XLF at z ~ 1-3 is significantly different from that in the local universe, for which the luminosity-dependent density evolution model gives much better description than the luminosity and density evolution model. These results establish the standard population synthesis model of the X-ray background (XRB), which well reproduces the source counts, the observed fractions of CTK AGNs, and the spectrum of the hard XRB. The number ratio of CTK AGNs to the absorbed Compton-thin (CTN) AGNs is constrained to be ≈0.5-1.6 to produce the 20-50 keV XRB intensity within present uncertainties, by assuming that they follow the same evolution as CTN AGNs. The growth history of supermassive black holes is discussed based on the new AGN bolometric luminosity function.},

@article{Martin:2007yg,
  abstract = {We introduce a new quantity, the mass flux density of galaxies evolving from the blue sequence to the red sequence. We propose a simple technique for constraining this mass flux using the volume-corrected number density in the extinction-corrected UV-optical color-magnitude distribution, the stellar age indexes HdeltaA and Dn(4000), and a simple prescription for spectral evolution using a quenched star formation history. We exploit the excellent separation of red and blue sequences in the NUV-r band Hess function. The final value we measure, rhoT˙=0.033 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, is strictly speaking an upper limit due to the possible contributions of bursting, composite, and extincted galaxies. However, it compares favorably with estimates of the average mass flux that we make based on the red luminosity function evolution derived from the DEEP2 and COMBO-17 surveys, rho˙R=+0.034 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3. We find that the blue sequence mass has remained roughly constant since z=1 (rhoB˙~=0.01 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, but the average on-going star formation of rho˙SF~=0.037 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3 over 0<z<1 is balanced by mass flux off the blue sequence. We explore the nature of the galaxies in the transition zone with particular attention to the frequency and impact of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The AGN fraction peaks in the transition zone. We find circumstantial, albeit weak evidence that the quench rates are higher in higher luminosity AGNs.},

  abstract = {Dust emission is one of the main windows to the physics of galaxies and to star formation as the radiation from young, hot stars is absorbed by the dust and reemitted at longer wavelengths. The recently launched Herschel satellite now provides a view of dust emission in the far-infrared at an unequaled resolution and quality up to 500 mum. In the context of the Herschel HERM33ES open time key project, we are studying the moderately inclined Scd local group galaxy M33 which is located only 840 kpc away. In this article, using Spitzer and Herschel data ranging from 3.6 mum to 500 mum, along with H I, Halpha maps, and Galaxy Evolution Explorer ultraviolet data, we have studied the emission of the dust at the high spatial resolution of 150 pc. Combining Spitzer and Herschel bands, we have provided new, inclination-corrected, resolved estimators of the total infrared brightness and of the star formation rate from any combination of these bands. The study of the colors of the warm and cold dust populations shows that the temperature of the former is, at high brightness, dictated by young massive stars but, at lower brightness, heating is taken over by the evolved populations. Conversely, the temperature of the cold dust is tightly driven by the evolved stellar populations.},

The MIPS data can be used to extend the photometry to wavebands that are not observed in these Herschel surveys and to check the photometry in cases where Herschel performs observations at the same wavelengths. Additionally, we measured globally integrated 24-160 mum flux densities for the galaxies in the sample that can be used for the construction of spectral energy distributions. Using MIPS photometry published by other references, we have confirmed that we are obtaining accurate photometry for these galaxies.},

The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to ˜N2 for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra  effort.

@article{Pierce:2010qy,
  abstract = {We describe the effect of active galactic nucleus (AGN) light on host galaxy optical and UV-optical colours, as determined from X-ray-selected AGN host galaxies at z ~ 1, and compare the AGN host galaxy colours to those of a control sample matched to the AGN sample in both redshift and stellar mass. We identify as X-ray-selected AGNs 8.7+4-3 per cent of the red-sequence control galaxies, 9.8 +/- 3 per cent of the blue-cloud control galaxies and 14.7+4-3 per cent of the green-valley control galaxies. The nuclear colours of AGN hosts are generally bluer than their outer colours, while the control galaxies exhibit redder nuclei. AGNs in blue-cloud host galaxies experience less X-ray obscuration, while AGNs in red-sequence hosts have more, which is the reverse of what is expected from general considerations of the interstellar medium. Outer and integrated colours of AGN hosts generally agree with the control galaxies, regardless of X-ray obscuration, but the nuclear colours of unobscured AGNs are typically much bluer, especially for X-ray luminous objects. Visible point sources are seen in many of these, indicating that the nuclear colours have been contaminated by AGN light and that obscuration of the X-ray radiation and visible light are therefore highly correlated. Red AGN hosts are typically slightly bluer than red-sequence control galaxies, which suggests that their stellar populations are slightly younger. We compare these colour data to current models of AGN formation. The unexpected trend of less X-ray obscuration in blue-cloud galaxies and more in red-sequence galaxies is problematic for all AGN feedback models, in which gas and dust is thought to be removed as star formation shuts down. A second class of models involving radiative instabilities in hot gas is more promising for red-sequence AGNs but predicts a larger number of point sources in red-sequence AGNs than is observed. Regardless, it appears that multiple AGN models are necessary to explain the varied AGN host properties discussed in the current work. Finally, we find that integrated optical and UV - optical colours are not strongly affected by X-ray-selected AGNs except in rare cases (<10 per cent), where the AGN is very luminous, unobscured and/or visible as a point source.},

@article{Goulding:2014fk,
  abstract = {We present the results of a combined galaxy population analysis for the host galaxies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) identified at 0 < z < 1.4 within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Bo{\"o}tes, and DEEP2 surveys. We identified AGN in a uniform and unbiased manner at X-ray, infrared, and radio wavelengths. Supermassive black holes undergoing radiatively efficient accretion (detected as X-ray and/or infrared AGN) appear to be hosted in a separate and distinct galaxy population than AGN undergoing powerful mechanically dominated accretion (radio AGN). Consistent with some previous studies, radiatively efficient AGN appear to be preferentially hosted in modest star-forming galaxies, with little dependence on AGN or galaxy luminosity. AGN exhibiting radio-emitting jets due to mechanically dominated accretion are almost exclusively observed in massive, passive galaxies. Crucially, we now provide strong evidence that the observed host-galaxy trends are independent of redshift. In particular, these different accretion-mode AGN have remained as separate galaxy populations throughout the last 9 Gyr. Furthermore, it appears that galaxies hosting AGN have evolved along the same path as galaxies that are not hosting AGN with little evidence for distinctly separate evolution.},

In the centimetre regime, we find diffuse components with Very Large Array (VLA) observations, and a variable compact core with a rising spectrum with Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations. Although the spectral index of the rising spectrum is consistent with the prediction of the simple advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF) model, the observed radio power is slightly high compared with that of the model prediction. A spectral break at centimetre-to-millimetre wavelengths is inferred from the upper limits of flux densities from Nobeyama Millimetre Array (NMA) and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) data at millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths, respectively. More complicated considerations are required for the theoretical model to interpret such observed radio properties.},

@article{Bastian:1998tx,
  abstract = {Radio emission from solar flares offers a number of unique diagnostic tools to address long-standing questions about energy release, plasma heating, particle acceleration, and particle transport in magnetized plasmas. At millimeter and centimeter wavelengths, incoherent gyrosynchrotron emission from electrons with energies of tens of kilo electron volts (keV) to several mega electron volts (MeV) plays a dominant role. These electrons carry a significant fraction of the energy released during the impulsive phase of flares. At decimeter and meter wavelengths, coherent plasma radiation can play a dominant role. Particularly important are type III and type III-like radio bursts, which are due to upward- and downward-directed beams of nonthermal electrons, presumed to originate in the energy release site. With the launch of Yohkoh and the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory, the relationship between radio emission and energetic photon emissions has been clarified. In this review, recent progress on our understanding of radio emission from impulsive flares and its relation to X-ray emission is discussed, as well as energy release in flare-like phenomena (microflares, nanoflares) and their bearing on coronal heating.},

  abstract = {We report the detection of CO(1-0) emission from NGC 1277, a lenticular galaxy in the Perseus Cluster, which has been proposed to host a $(1.3-1.7) \times 10^{10}\ M_\odot$ black hole (BH) based on stellar kinematic measurements. The CO(1-0) emission, observed with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) using both, a more extended (~1-arcsec resolution) and a more compact (~2.5-arcsec resolution) configuration, is likely to originate from the dust lane encompassing the galaxy nucleus at a distance of 0.9 arcsec (~320 pc). The spatially-unresolved double-horned CO(1-0) profile found at 2.5-arcsec resolution is likely to trace gas orbiting in the dust lane with rotational velocities of ~520 km s$^{-1}$, indicative of an enclosed mass of ~$2 \times 10^{10}\ M_\odot$. Based on models with realistic mass distributions, the CO(1-0) kinematics is found to be consistent with a ~$1.7 \times 10^{10}\ M_\odot$ BH, while a less massive BH is still possible assuming a large stellar mass-to-light ratio. The strongest CO(1-0) component, centred at ~+500 km s$^{-1}$, is detected at 1-arcsec resolution. It shows an offset from the underlying continuum peak and may originate from a gas clump near the eastern orbital node of the dust lane. The extended 2.6-mm continuum emission is likely associated with a weak AGN, possibly characterized by an inverted radio-to-millimetre spectral energy distribution. Literature radio and X-ray data indicate that an ultra-massive BH in NGC 1277 would not only be over-massive with respect to the BH scaling relations, but also with respect to the fundamental plane of BH activity.},

@article{Behar:2015le,
  abstract = {The physical origin of radio emission in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQ AGN) remains unclear, whether it is a downscaled version of the relativistic jets typical of radio-loud (RL) AGN, or whether it originates from the accretion disc. The correlation between 5 GHz and X-ray luminosities of RQ AGN, which follows LR = 10-5LX observed also in stellar coronae, suggests an association of both X-ray and radio sources with the accretion disc corona. Observing RQ AGN at higher (mm-wave) frequencies, where synchrotron self-absorption is diminished, and smaller regions can be probed, is key to exploring this association. Eight RQ AGN, selected based on their high X-ray brightness and variability, were observed at 95 GHz with the CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimetre-wave Astronomy) and ATCA (the Australia Telescope Compact Array) telescopes. All targets were detected at the 1-10 mJy level. Emission excess at 95 GHz of up to ×7 is found with respect to archival low-frequency steep spectra, suggesting a compact, optically thick core superimposed on the more extended structures that dominate at low frequencies. Though unresolved, the 95 GHz fluxes imply optically thick source sizes of 10-4-10-3 pc, or ˜10-1000 gravitational radii. The present sources lie tightly along an LR (95 GHz) = 10-4LX (2-10 keV) correlation, analogous to that of stellar coronae and RQ AGN at 5 GHz, while RL AGN are shown to have higher LR/LX ratios. The present observations argue that simultaneous mm-wave and X-ray monitoring of RQ AGN features a promising method for understanding accretion disc coronal emission.},

In addition, we performed quasi-simultaneous observations at 150 GHz (lambda2 mm) and 100 GHz for five LLAGNs. Compact nuclear emissions showing flat or inverted spectra at centimeter-to-millimeter wavelengths were found in many LLAGNs and several early-type galaxies. Moreover, significant flux variability was detected in three LLAGNs. These radio properties are similar to Sgr A*. The observed radio luminosities are consistent with the fundamental plane of black hole activity that was suggested on the basis of samples with black hole masses ranging from 10 to 1010 M sun. This implies nuclear jets powered by radiatively inefficient accretion flows onto black holes.},

We confirm the presence of two dominant circumnuclear IR-bright regions surrounding the central super star cluster that had been previously noted at mid-IR wavelengths and in the sub-mm by LABOCA. On constructing a global spectral energy distribution using the SPIRE and PACS photometry, in conjunction with archival IR measurements, we note the presence of an excess at sub-mm wavelengths. This excess suggests the presence of a signiPcant cold dust component within NGC 1705 and was modeled as an additional cold component in the SED. Although alternative explanations for the sub-mm excess beyond 350 mum, such as changes to the dust emissivity cannot be ruled out, the most likely explanation for the observed submillimetre excess is that of an additional cold dust component.},

@article{Paradis:2012oj,
  abstract = {Context. Past and recent observations have revealed unexpected variations in the far-infrared - millimeter (FIR-mm) dust emissivity in the interstellar medium. In the Herschel spectral range, those are often referred to as a 500 mum emission excess. Several dust emission models have been developed to interpret astrophysical data in the FIR-mm domain. However, these are commonly unable to fully reconcile theoretical predictions with observations. In contrast, the recently revised two level system (TLS) model, based on the disordered internal structure of amorphous dust grains, seems to provide a promising way of interpreting existing data.  Aims: The newly available Herschel infrared GALactic (Hi-GAL) data, which covers most of the inner Milky Way, offers a unique opportunity to investigate possible variations in the dust emission properties both with wavelength and environment. The goal of our analysis is to constrain the internal structure of the largest dust grains on Galactic scales, in the framework of the TLS model.  Methods: By combining the IRIS (Improved Reprocessing of the IRAS Survey) 100 mum with the Hi-GAL 160, 250, 350, and 500 mum data, we model the dust emission spectra in each pixel of the Hi-GAL maps, using both the TLS model and, for comparison, a single modified black-body fit. The effect of temperature mixing along the line of sight is investigated to test the robustness of our results.  Results: We find a slight decrease in the dust temperature with distance from the Galactic center, confirming previous results. We also report the detection of a significant 500 mum emissivity excess in the peripheral regions of the plane (35$\,^{\circ}$ < |l| < 70$\,^{\circ}$) of about 13-15% of the emissivity, which can reach up to 20% in some HII regions. We present the spatial distributions of the best-fit values for the two main parameters of the TLS model, i.e. the charge correlation length, lc, used to characterize the disordered charge distribution (DCD) part of the model, and the amplitude A of the TLS processes with respect to the DCD effect. These distributions illustrate the variations in the dust properties with environment, in particular the plausible existence of an overall gradient with distance to the Galactic center. A comparison with previous findings in the solar neighborhood shows that the local value of the excess is less than expected from the Galactic gradient observed here.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

  abstract = {We utilize Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging and spectroscopy of ~53,000 star-forming galaxies at z~0.1 to study the relation between stellar mass and gas-phase metallicity. We derive gas-phase oxygen abundances and stellar masses using new techniques that make use of the latest stellar evolutionary synthesis and photoionization models. We find a tight (+/-0.1 dex) correlation between stellar mass and metallicity spanning over 3 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and a factor of 10 in metallicity. The relation is relatively steep from 108.5 to 1010.5 Msolar h-270, in good accord with known trends between luminosity and metallicity, but flattens above 1010.5 Msolar. We use indirect estimates of the gas mass based on the Halpha luminosity to compare our data to predictions from simple closed box chemical evolution models. We show that metal loss is strongly anticorrelated with baryonic mass, with low-mass dwarf galaxies being 5 times more metal depleted than L* galaxies at z~0.1. Evidence for metal depletion is not confined to dwarf galaxies but is found in galaxies with masses as high as 1010 Msolar. We interpret this as strong evidence of both the ubiquity of galactic winds and their effectiveness in removing metals from galaxy potential wells.},

  abstract = {The integrated spectral energy distributions (SED) of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) appear significantly flatter than expected from dust models based on their far-infrared and radio emission. The still unexplained origin of this millimetre excess is investigated here using the Planck data. The integrated SED of the two galaxies before subtraction of the foreground (Milky Way) and background (CMB fluctuations) emission are in good agreement with previous determinations, confirming the presence of the millimetre excess. In the context of this preliminary analysis we do not propose a full multi-component fitting of the data, but instead subtract contributions unrelated to the galaxies and to dust emission. The background CMB contribution is subtracted using an internal linear combination (ILC) method performed locally around the galaxies. The foreground emission from the Milky Way is subtracted as a Galactic Hi template, and the dust emissivity is derived in a region surrounding the two galaxies and dominated by Milky Way emission. After subtraction, the remaining emission of both galaxies correlates closely with the atomic and molecular gas emission of the LMC and SMC. The millimetre excess in the LMC can be explained by CMB fluctuations, but a significant excess is still present in the SMC SED. The Planck and IRAS-IRIS data at 100 mum are combined to produce thermal dust temperature and optical depth maps of the two galaxies. The LMC temperature map shows the presence of a warm inner arm already found with the Spitzer data, but which also shows the existence of a previously unidentified cold outer arm. Several cold regions are found along this arm, some of which are associated with known molecular clouds. The dust optical depth maps are used to constrain the thermal dust emissivity power-law index (beta). The average spectral index is found to be consistent with beta = 1.5 and beta = 1.2 below 500mum for the LMC and SMC respectively, significantly flatter than the values observed in the Milky Way. Also, there is evidence in the SMC of a further flattening of the SED in the sub-mm, unlike for the LMC where the SED remains consistent with beta = 1.5. The spatial distribution of the millimetre dustexcess in the SMC follows the gas and thermal dust distribution. Different models are explored in order to fit the dust emission in the SMC. It is concluded that the millimetre excess is unlikely to be caused by very cold dust emission and that it could be due to a combination of spinning dust emission and thermal dust emission by more amorphous dust grains than those present in our Galaxy.

  abstract = {The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) has surprisingly strong submillimeter- and millimeter-wavelength emission that is inconsistent with standard dust models, including those with emission from spinning dust. Here, we show that the emission from the SMC may be understood if the interstellar dust mixture includes magnetic nanoparticles, emitting magnetic dipole radiation resulting from thermal fluctuations in the magnetization. The magnetic grains can be metallic iron, magnetite Fe3O4, or maghemite gamma-Fe2O3. The required mass of iron is consistent with elemental abundance constraints. The magnetic dipole emission is predicted to be polarized orthogonally to the normal electric dipole radiation if the nanoparticles are inclusions in larger grains. We speculate that other low-metallicity galaxies may also have a large fraction of the interstellar Fe in magnetic materials.},

@article{Paradis:2009hb,
  abstract = {Aims: Dust properties appear to vary according to the environment in which the dust evolves. Previous observational indications of these variations in the far-infrared (FIR) and submillimeter (submm) spectral range are scarce and limited to specific regions of the sky. To determine whether these results can be generalised to larger scales, we study the evolution in dust emissivities from the FIR to millimeter (mm) wavelengths, in the atomic and molecular interstellar medium (ISM), along the Galactic plane towards the outer Galaxy.  Methods: We correlate the dust FIR to mm emission with the HI and CO emission, which are taken to trace the atomic and molecular phases, respectively. The study is carried out using the DIRBE data from 100 to 240 mum, the Archeops data from 550 mum to 2.1 mm, and the WMAP data at 3.2 mm (W band), in regions with Galactic latitude |b| <= 30$\,^{\circ}$, over the Galactic longitude range (75$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 198$\,^{\circ}$) observed with Archeops. We estimate the average dust temperature in each phase and divide the emission spectral energy distribution (SED) by a black body at this temperature to derive the emissivity profile. A detailed verification of the impact of the implied simplification, such as temperature mixing along the line of sight, is provided.  Results: In all regions studied, the emissivity spectra in both the atomic and molecular phases are steeper in the FIR (beta = 2.4) than in the submm and mm (beta = 1.5). We find significant variations in the spectral shape of the dust emissivity as a function of the dust temperature in the molecular phase. Regions of similar dust temperature in the molecular and atomic gas exhibit similar emissivity spectra. Regions where the dust is significantly colder in the molecular phase show a significant increase in emissivity for the range 100-550 mum. We exclude the possibility of this effect being an artifact of our temperature determination or the assumptions made. This result supports the hypothesis of grain coagulation in these regions, confirming results obtained over small fractions of the sky in previous studies and allowing us to expand these results to the cold molecular environments in general of the outer MW. Possible reasons for the observed emissivity increase in the molecular phase that vanishes in the mm range are discussed by comparison with dust models, involving dust aggregation and solid state physics processes specific to amorphous material. We note that it is the first time that these effects have been demonstrated by direct measurement of the emissivity, while previous studies were based only on thermal arguments.

@article{Galametz:2009cl,
  abstract = {Aims. We study the dust properties of four low metallicity galaxies by modelling their spectral energy distributions. This modelling enables us to constrain the dust properties such as the mass, the temperature or the composition to characterise the global ISM properties in dwarf galaxies. Methods: We present 870 mum images of four low metallicity galaxies (NGC 1705, Haro 11, Mrk 1089 and UM 311) observed with the Large APEX BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA) on the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescope. We modeled their spectral energy distributions combining the submm observations of LABOCA, 2MASS, IRAS, Spitzer photometric data, and the IRS data for Haro 11. Results: We found that the PAH mass abundance is very low in these galaxies, 5 to 50 times lower than the PAH mass fraction of our Galaxy. We also found that a significant mass of dust is revealed when using submm constraints compared to that measured with only mid-IR to far-IR observations extending only to 160 mum. For NGC 1705 and Haro 11, an excess in submillimeter wavelengths was detected when we used our standard dust SED model. We rerun our SED procedure adding a cold dust component (10 K) to better describe the high 870 mum flux derived from LABOCA observations, which significantly improves the fit. We found that at least 70% of the dust mass of these two galaxies can reside in a cold dust component. We also showed that the subsequent dust-to-gas mass ratios, considering HI and CO observations, can be strikingly high for Haro 11 in comparison with what is usually expected for these low-metallicity environments. Furthermore, we derived the star formation rate of our galaxies and compared them to the Schmidt law. Haro 11 falls anomalously far from the Schmidt relation. These results may suggest that a reservoir of hidden gas could be present in molecular form not traced by the current CO observations. While there can be a significant cold dust mass found in Haro 11, the SED peaks at exceptionally short wavelengths (36 mum), also highlighting the importance of the much warmer dust component heated by the massive star clusters in Haro 11. We also derived the total IR luminosities derived from our models and compared them with relations that derive this luminosity from Spitzer bands. We found that the Draine & Li (2007) formula compares well to our direct IR determinations.},

  abstract = {We model the infrared to submillimetre spectral energy distribution of 11 nearby galaxies of the Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel sample using Spitzer and Herschel data and compare model extrapolations at 870 mum (using different fitting techniques) with Large APEX BOlometer CAmera (LABOCA) 870 mum observations. We investigate how the differences between predictions and observations vary with model assumptions or environment. At global scales, we find that modified blackbody models using realistic cold emissivity indices (betac = 2 or 1.5) are able to reproduce the 870 mum observed emission within the uncertainties for most of the sample. Low values (betac < 1.3) would be required in NGC 0337, NGC 1512 and NGC 7793. At local scales, we observe a systematic 870 mum excess when using betac = 2.0. The betac = 1.5 or the Draine & Li (2007) models can reconcile predictions with observations in part of the discs. Some of the remaining `excesses' occur towards the centres and can be partly or fully accounted for by non-dust contributions such as CO(3-2) or, to a lesser extent, free-free or synchrotron emission. In three non-barred galaxies, the remaining excesses rather occur in the disc outskirts. This could be a sign of a flattening of the submm slope (and decrease of the effective emissivity index) with radius in these objects.},

@article{Kirkpatrick:2014ef,
  abstract = {We investigate the far-infrared (IR) dust emission for 20 local star forming galaxies from the Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: A Far-IR Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH) sample. We model the far-IR/submillimeter spectral energy distribution (SED) using images from Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory. We calculate the cold dust temperature (Tc ) and emissivity (beta) on a pixel by pixel basis (where each pixel ranges from 0.1 to 3 kpc2) using a two-temperature modified blackbody fitting routine. Our fitting method allows us to investigate the resolved nature of temperature and emissivity variations by modeling from the galaxy centers to the outskirts (physical scales of ~15-50 kpc, depending on the size of the galaxy). We fit each SED in two ways: (1) fit Tc and beta simultaneously, (2) hold beta constant and fit Tc . We compare Tc and beta with star formation rates (calculated from L Halpha and L 24 mum), the luminosity of the old stellar population (traced through L 3.6 mum), and the dust mass surface density (traced by 500 mum luminosity, L 500). We find a significant trend between SFR/L 500 and Tc , implying that the flux of hard UV photons relative to the amount of dust is significantly contributing to the heating of the cold, or diffuse, dust component. We also see a trend between L 3.6/L 500 and beta, indicating that the old stellar population contributes to the heating at far-IR/submillimeter wavelengths. Finally, we find that when beta is held constant, Tc exhibits a strongly decreasing radial trend, illustrating that the shape of the far-IR SED is changing radially through a galaxy, thus confirming on a sample almost double in size the trends observed in Galametz et al.},

@article{Gordon:2014if,
  abstract = {The dust properties in the Large and Small Magellanic clouds (LMC/SMC) are studied using the HERITAGE Herschel Key Project photometric data in five bands from 100 to 500 mum. Three simple models of dust emission were fit to the observations: a single temperature blackbody modified by a power-law emissivity (SMBB), a single temperature blackbody modified by a broken power-law emissivity (BEMBB), and two blackbodies with different temperatures, both modified by the same power-law emissivity (TTMBB). Using these models, we investigate the origin of the submillimeter excess, defined as the submillimeter emission above that expected from SMBB models fit to observations <200 mum. We find that the BEMBB model produces the lowest fit residuals with pixel-averaged 500 mum submillimeter excesses of 27% and 43% for the LMC and SMC, respectively. Adopting gas masses from previous works, the gas-to-dust ratios calculated from our fitting results show that the TTMBB fits require significantly more dust than are available even if all the metals present in the interstellar medium (ISM) were condensed into dust. This indicates that the submillimeter excess is more likely to be due to emissivity variations than a second population of colder dust. We derive integrated dust masses of (7.3 $\pm$ 1.7) × 105 and (8.3 $\pm$ 2.1) × 104 M &sun; for the LMC and SMC, respectively. We find significant correlations between the submillimeter excess and other dust properties; further work is needed to determine the relative contributions of fitting noise and ISM physics to the correlations.

@article{Hunt:2015rp,
  abstract = {Physical conditions of the interstellar medium in galaxies are closely linked to the ambient radiation field and the heating of dust grains. In order to characterize dust properties in galaxies over a wide range of physical conditions, we present here the radial surface brightness profiles of the entire sample of 61 galaxies from Key Insights into Nearby Galaxies: Far-Infrared Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH). The main goal of our work is the characterization of the grain emissivities, dust temperatures, and interstellar radiation fields (ISRFs) responsible for heating the dust. We first fit the radial profiles with exponential functions in order to compare stellar and cool-dust disk scalelengths, as measured by 3.6 mum and 250 mum surface brightnesses. Our results show thatthe stellar and dust scalelengths are comparable, with a mean ratio of 1.04, although several galaxies show dust-to-stellar scalelength ratios of 1.5 or more. We then fit the far-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) in each annular region with single-temperature modified blackbodies using both variable (MBBV) and fixed (MBBF) emissivity indices beta, as well as with physically motivated dust models. The KINGFISH profiles are well suited to examining trends of dust temperature Tdust and beta because they span a factor of ~200 in the ISRF intensity heating the bulk of the dust mass, Umin. Results from fitting the profile SEDs suggest that, on average, Tdust, dust optical depth taudust, and Umin decrease with radius. The emissivity index beta also decreases with radius in some galaxies, but in others is increasing, or rising in the inner regions and falling in the outer ones. Despite the fixed grain emissivity (average beta ~ 2.1) of the physically-motivated models, they are well able to accommodate flat spectral slopes with beta ≲ 1. An analysis of the wavelength variations of dust emissivities in both the data and the models shows that flatter slopes (beta ≲ 1.5) are associated with cooler temperatures, contrary to what would be expected from the usual Tdust - beta degeneracy. This trend is related to variations in Umin since beta and Umin are very closely linked over the entire range in Umin sampled by the KINGFISH galaxies: low Umin is associated with flat beta ≲ 1. Both these results strongly suggest that the low apparent beta values (flat slopes) in MBBV fits are caused by temperature mixing along the line of sight, rather than by intrinsic variations in grain properties. Finally, a comparison of dust models and the data show a slight ~10% excess at 500 mum for low metallicity (12 + log (O/H) ≲ 8) and low far-infrared surface brightness (Sigma500).

@article{Gordon:2010ix,
  abstract = {Context. The properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derived from fitting far-IR SEDs (>=100 mum). Only with SPIRE on Herschel has it been possible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 mum that is beyond the peak (~160 mum) of dust emission in most galaxies.  Aims: We investigate the differences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only <200 mum data and then also including >200 mum data (new SPIRE observations) to determine how important having >200 mum data is for deriving these dust properties.  Methods: We fit the 100 to 350 mum observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) point-by-point with a model that consists of a single temperature and fixed emissivity law. The data used are existing observations at 100 and 160 mum (from IRAS and Spitzer) and new SPIRE observations of 1/4 of the LMC observed for the HERITAGE key project as part of the Herschel science demonstration phase.  Results: The dust temperatures and masses computed using only 100 and 160 mum data can differ by up to 10% and 36%, respectively, from those that also include the SPIRE 250 & 350 mum data. We find that an emissivity law proportional to lambda-1.5 minimizes the 100-350 mum fractional residuals. We find that the emission at 500 mum is ~10% higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths. We find the fractional 500 mum excess is weakly anti-correlated with MIPS 24 mum flux and the total gas surface density. This argues against a flux calibration error as the origin of the 500 mum excess. Our results do not allow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelength dependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable at lambda >= 500 mum for the origin of the 500 mum excess.

@article{Bot:2010zm,
  abstract = {Context. Dust emission at sub-millimeter to centimeter wavelengths is often simply the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of dust particles at thermal equilibrium and is used as a cold mass tracer in various environments, including nearby galaxies. However, well-sampled spectral energy distributions of the nearby, star-forming Magellanic Clouds have a pronounced (sub-)millimeter excess.  Aims: This study attempts to confirm the existence of this millimeter excess above expected dust, free-free and synchrotron emission and to explore different possibilities for its origin.  Methods: We model near-infrared to radio spectral energy distributions of the Magellanic Clouds with dust, free-free, and synchrotron emission. A millimeter excess emission is confirmed above these components and its spectral shape and intensity are analyzed in light of different scenarios: very cold dust, cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations, a change of the dust spectral index and spinning dust emission.  Results: We show that very cold dust or CMB fluctuations are very unlikely explanations for the observed excess in these two galaxies. The excess in the Large Magellanic Cloud can be satisfactorily explained either by a change of the spectral index related to intrinsic properties of amorphous grains, or by spinning dust emission. In the Small Magellanic Cloud, however, the excess is larger and the dust grain model including TLS/DCD effects cannot reproduce the observed emission in a simple way. A possible solution was achieved with spinning dust emission, but many assumptions on the physical state of the interstellar medium had to be made.  Conclusions: Further studies, with higher resolution data from Planck and Herschel are needed to probe the origin of this observed submillimeter-centimeter excess more definitely. Our study shows that the different possible origins will be best distinguished where the excess is the highest, as is the case in the Small Magellanic Cloud.},

@article{Galametz:2011ao,
  abstract = {Aims: We are studying the effects of submm observations on the total dust mass and thus dust-to-gas mass ratio measurements.  Methods: We gather a wide sample of galaxies that have been observed at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths to model their spectral energy distributions using submm observations (>160 mum) and then without submm observational constraints in order to quantify the error on the dust mass when submm data are not available. Our model does not make strong assumptions on the dust temperature distribution to precisely avoid submm biaises in the study. Our sample includes 52 galaxies observed at submm wavelengths. Out of these, 9 galaxies show an excess in submm which is not accounted for in our fiducial model, most of these galaxies being low-metallicity dwarfs. We chose to add an independant very cold dust component (T = 10 K) to account for this excess.  Results: We find that metal-rich galaxies modelled with submm data often show lower dust masses than when modelled without submm data. Indeed, these galaxies usually have dust SEDs that peaks at longer wavelengths and require constraints above 160 mum to correctly position the peak and sample the submillimeter slope of their SEDs and thus correctly cover the dust temperature distribution. On the other hand, some metal-poor dwarf galaxies modelled with submm data show higher dust masses than when modelled without submm data. Using submm constraints for the dust mass estimates, we find a tightened correlation of the dust-to-gas mass ratio with the metallicity of the galaxies. We also often find that when there is a submm excess present, it occurs preferentially in low-metallicity galaxies. We analyse the conditions for the presence of this excess and find a relation between the 160/850 mum ratio and the submm excess.},

@article{Kirkpatrick:2013wq,
  abstract = {Submillimeter excess emission has been reported at 500 mum in a handful of local galaxies, and previous studies suggest that it could be correlated with metal abundance. We investigate the presence of an excess submillimeter emission at 500 mum for a sample of 20 galaxies from the Key Insights on Nearby Galaxies: a Far Infrared Survey with Herschel (KINGFISH) that span a range of morphologies and metallicities (12 + log (O/H) = 7.8-8.7). We probe the far-infrared (IR) emission using images from the Spitzer Space Telescope and Herschel Space Observatory in the wavelength range 24-500 mum. We model the far-IR peak of the dust emission with a two-temperature modified blackbody and measure excess of the 500 mum photometry relative to that predicted by our model. We compare the submillimeter excess, where present, with global galaxy metallicity and, where available, resolved metallicity measurements. We do not find any correlation between the 500 mum excess and metallicity. A few individual sources do show excess (10%-20%) at 500 mum conversely, for other sources, the model overpredicts the measured 500 mum flux density by as much as 20%, creating a 500 mum deficit. None of our sources has an excess larger than the calculated 1sigma uncertainty, leading us to conclude that there is no substantial excess at submillimeter wavelengths at or shorter than 500 mum in our sample. Our results differ from previous studies detecting 500 mum excess in KINGFISH galaxies largely due to new, improved photometry used in this study.},

@article{Bendo:2015lr,
  abstract = {We examined variations in the 160/250 and 250/350 mum surface brightness ratios within 24 nearby (<30 Mpc) face-on spiral galaxies observed with the Herschel Space Observatory to identify the heating mechanisms for dust emitting at these wavelengths. The analysis consisted of both qualitative and quantitative comparisons of the 160/250 and 250/350 mum ratios to Halpha and 24 mum emission, which trace the light from star-forming regions, and 3.6 mum emission, which traces the light from the older stellar populations of the galaxies. We find broad variations in the heating mechanisms for the dust. In one subset of galaxies, we found evidence that emission at <=160 mum (and in rare cases potentially at <=350 mum) originates from dust heated by star-forming regions. In another subset, we found that the emission at >=250 mum (and sometimes at >=160 mum) originates from dust heated by the older stellar population. In the rest of the sample, either the results are indeterminate or both of these stellar populations may contribute equally to the global dust heating. The observed variations in dust heating mechanisms do not necessarily match what has been predicted by dust emission and radiative transfer models, which could lead to overestimated dust temperatures, underestimated dust masses, false detections of variability in dust emissivity, and inaccurate star formation rate measurements.},

We derived them using 11 bands of photometry from the NDWFS, FLAMEX, zBo{\"o}tes, and IRAC Shallow surveys for 16,033 galaxies in the NDWFS Bo{\"o}tes field with spectroscopic redshifts measured by the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey. We also developed algorithms to accurately determine photometric redshifts, K-corrections, and bolometric luminosities using these templates. Our photometric redshifts have an accuracy of sigmaz/(1+z)=0.04 when clipped to the best 95%. We used these templates to study the spectral type distribution in the field and to estimate luminosity functions of galaxies as a function of redshift and spectral type. In particular, we note that the 5-8 mum color distribution of galaxies is bimodal, much like the optical g-r colors.},

@article{Simkin:1999uo,
  abstract = {We present a variety of new imaging and kinematic data for the double-lobed radio galaxy Pictor A. The new optical data include Hubble Space Telescope (HST) continuum and [O III], emission-line images (at a resolution of 25-100 mas) and ground-based imaging and spectroscopy (at a resolution of ~1.5). The ground-based images show Halpha filaments and loops which extend to the north and west of the optical core. The radio continuum data include 3 cm Australia Telescope images of the core, at a resolution comparable to that of the optical, ground-based images, and a VLBI image of a jet in the compact core (at a resolution of 2-25 mas), which seems to align with a continuum ``jet'' found in the HST images. The core radio jet, the HST optical continuum ``jet,'' and the NW Halpha filaments all appear to be aligned with the extended, low-luminosity radio continuum bridge which Perley et al. have traced out to the optical-synchrotron hot spot in the NW lobe of this object. The Halpha filaments which appear to lie in the path of this trajectory are associated with a disrupted velocity field in the extended ionized gas. These filaments (as well as the extended [O III] emission found at mas scales in the HST images) may have been pushed to the north, out of the path of the jet. The ground-based spectra which cover this trajectory also yield line ratios for the ionized gas which have anomalously low [N II] (6564), suggesting either a complex, clumpy structure in the gas with a higher cloud-covering factor at larger radii and with denser clouds than is found in the nuclear regions of most NLRG and Seyfert 2 galaxies, or some other, unmodeled, mechanism for the emergent spectrum from this region. The Halpha emission-line filaments to the north appear to be associated with a 3 cm radio continuum knot which lies in a gap in the filaments ~4 from the nucleus. Altogether, the data in this paper provide good circumstantial evidence for nondisruptive redirection of a radio jet by interstellar gas clouds in the host galaxy.},

@article{Marscher:2002xe,
  abstract = {Accretion of gas onto black holes is thought to power the relativistic jets of material ejected from active galactic nuclei (AGN) and the `microquasars' located in our Galaxy. In microquasars, superluminal radio-emitting features appear and propagate along the jet shortly after sudden decreases in the X-ray fluxes. This establishes a direct observational link between the black hole and the jet: the X-ray dip is probably caused by the disappearance of a section of the inner accretion disk as it falls past the event horizon, while the remainder of the disk section is ejected into the jet, creating the appearance of a superluminal bright spot. No such connection has hitherto been established for AGN, because of insufficient multi-frequency data. Here we report the results of three years of monitoring the X-ray and radio emission of the galaxy 3C120. As has been observed for microquasars, we find that dips in the X-ray emission are followed by ejections of bright superluminal knots in the radio jet. The mean time between X-ray dips appears to scale roughly with the mass of the black hole, although there are at present only a few data points.},

  abstract = {VLA maps and video camera images of 3C 120 are discussed. The radio structure at 6 and 20 cm extends approximately 25-30 arcsec (approximately 18 kpc) west of the nucleus and curves from a position angle of -96 deg near the nucleus to -63 deg at its end. The extended structure, which possesses a much steeper spectral index (alpha, approximately -0.6) than the nucleus (alpha, approximately 0) is seen as a large-scale extension of the milli-arcsecond structure observed with VLBI techniques. It is noted that, in many respects, 3C 120 is a low-luminosity member of the 'D2' class of radio sources. No general correspondence between the radio structure and the observed stellar and gaseous structures is found.},

@article{de-Jong:2012rw,
  abstract = {Aims: We attempt to determine the nature of the high energy emission of the radio galaxy 3C 111, by distinguishing between the effects of the thermal and non-thermal processes.  Methods: We study the X-ray spectrum of 3C 111 between 0.4 keV and 200 keV, and its spectral energy distribution, using data from the Suzaku satellite combined with INTEGRAL, Swift/BAT data, and Fermi/LAT data. We then model the overall spectral energy distribution by including radio and infrared data.  Results: The combined Suzaku, Swift and INTEGRAL data are represented by an absorbed exponentially cut-off power-law with reflection from neutral material with a photon index Gamma = 1.68 $\pm$ 0.03, a high-energy cut-off Ecut = 227-67+143 keV, a reflection component with R = 0.7 $\pm$ 0.3 and a Gaussian component to account for the iron emission-line at 6.4 keV with an equivalent width of EW = 85 $\pm$ 11 eV. The X-ray spectrum appears dominated by thermal, Seyfert-like processes, but there are also indications of non-thermal processes. The radio to gamma-ray spectral energy distribution can be fit with a single-zone synchrotron-self Compton model, with no need for an additional thermal component.  Conclusions: We suggest a hybrid scenario to explain the broad-band emission, including a thermal component (iron line, reflection) that dominates in the X-ray regime and a non-thermal one to explain the spectral energy distribution.},

@article{Shi:2005rc,
  abstract = {We report MIPS photometry of 20 radio-loud quasars and galaxies at 24 and 70 mum (and of five at 160 mum). We combine this sample with additional sources detected in the far-infrared by IRAS and ISO for a total of 47 objects, including 23 steep-spectrum type I AGNs: radio-loud quasars and broad-line radio galaxies; and 24 type II AGNs: narrow-line and weak-line FR II radio galaxies. Of this sample, the far-infrared emission of all but 3C 380 appears to be dominated by emission by dust heated by the AGN and by star formation. The AGN appears to contribute more than 50% of the far-infrared luminosity in most of the sources. It is also expected that the material around the nucleus is optically thin in the far-infrared. Thus, the measurements at these wavelengths can be used to test the orientation-dependent unification model. As predicted by the model, the behavior of the sources is consistent with the presence of an obscuring circumnuclear torus; in fact, we find that it may still have significant optical depth at 24 mum. In addition, as expected for the radio-loud quasars, there is a significant correlation between the low-frequency radio (178 MHz) and the 70 mum emission, two presumably isotropic indicators of nuclear activity. This result is consistent with the simple unified scheme. However, there is a population of radio galaxies that are underluminous at 70 mum compared with the radio-loud quasars and hence are a challenge to the simple unified model.},

  abstract = {Historically, Seyfert nuclei have been considered to be radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We question this widely held assumption by showing that the distribution of the radio-to-optical luminosity ratio, R≡Lnu(6 cm)/Lnu(B), when properly measured for the nuclear component, places the majority of type 1 Seyfert nuclei in the category of radio-loud AGNs, defined here as objects with R>=10. This result is further strengthened by strong correlations found between radio power and optical continuum and emission-line luminosities, as has been established previously for more powerful AGNs. We also present a new calibration of the relation between optical continuum and Balmer emission-line luminosities valid in the regime of low-luminosity AGNs.},

@article{Rush:1996db,
  abstract = {We report the results of 20, 6, and 2 cm VLA and 1.5 cm OVRO observations of two similar radio-quiet active galaxy and quasar (AGN) samples: the optically selected CfA Seyfert galaxies and the bolometric flux-limited 12 micron active galaxy sample. Every object observed was detected at 6 cm. Only ~6%-~8% of the 12 micron sample Seyfert galaxies (three to four objects) are radio-loud (and none of the CfA sample), as compared to 15%-20% for the Bright Quasar Survey quasars. These radio- loud objects are compact and have flat spectra, distinguishing them from the more common radio-quiet objects. The 6-20 cm slopes of the Seyfert 1's and 2's are similar, with average values of <alpha^20^_6 cm_> = -0.66 and -0.71, respectively. Although several Seyfert 1's are significantly flatter than this in their 6-20 and/or 1.5-6 cm slopes, there is no systematic trend for either Seyfert type to display upward or downward spectral curvature. Excluding the radio-loud quasars, the integrated 6 cm radio luminosity is linearly proportional to the 60 micron luminosity over several orders of magnitude, with on average twice the radio power of normal spirals of the same far-infrared power. About half of the objects show extended 6 cm emission, contributing on average 33% of the total flux. Thus the luminosities of these extended components alone are comparable to normal spirals of similar infrared luminosities. The 12 micron sample radio luminosity function is slightly higher than that of the CfA sample. The integrated space density of Seyfert 2's is ~2 times that of Seyfert 1's over their common range in luminosity. In terms of the standard unified model, this ratio in space density corresponds to a typical half-angle of the torus of theta ~ 48^deg^.},

This survey (the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey, or SUMSS) produces images with a resolution of 43x43 csc|delta| and an rms noise level of ~1 mJy beam^-1. The SUMSS is therefore similar in sensitivity and resolution to the northern NRAO VLA Sky Survey. The survey is progressing at a rate of about 1000 deg^2 per year, yielding individual and statistical data for many thousands of weak radio sources. This paper describes the main characteristics of the survey and presents sample images from the first year of observations.},

@article{Becker:1995lq,
  abstract = {The FIRST survey to produce Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters is now underway using the NRAO Very Large Array. We describe here the scientific motivation for a large-area sky survey at radio frequencies which has a sensitivity and angular resolution comparable to the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, and we recount the history that led to the current survey project. The technical design of the survey is covered in detail, including a description and justification of the grid pattern chosen, the rationale behind the integration time and angular resolution selected, and a summary of the other considerations which informed our planning for the project. A comprehensive description of the automated data analysis pipeline we have developed is presented.  We also report here the results of the first year of FIRST observations. A total of 144 hr of time in 1993 April and May was used for a variety of tests, as well as to cover an initial strip of the survey extending between 07h 15m and 16h 30m in a 2$\,^{\circ}$.8 wide declination zone passing through the local zenith (28.2 <delta < 31.0). A total of 2153 individual pointings yielded an image database containing 1039 merged images 46'.5 × 34'.5 in extent with 1.8 pixels and a typical rms of 0.13 mJy. A catalog derived from this 300 deg2 region contains 28,000 radio sources. We have performed extensive tests on the images and source list in order to establish the photometric and astrometric accuracy of these data products. We find systematic astrometric errors of < 0.05 individual sources down to the 1 mJy survey flux density threshold have 90% confidence error circles with radii of < 1. CLEAN bias introduces a systematic underestimate of point-source flux densities of ˜0.25 mJy; the bias is more severe for extended sources. Nonetheless, a comparison with a published deep survey field demonstrates that we successfully detect 39/49 sources with integrated flux densities greater than 0.75 mJy, including 19 of 20 sources above 2.0 mJy; the sources not detected are known to be very extended and so have surface brightnesses well below our threshold.  With 480 hr of observing time committed for each of the next three B-configuration periods, FIRST will complete nearly one-half of its goal of covering the 10,000 deg2 of the north Galactic cap scheduled for inclusion in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. All of the FIRST data raw visibilities, self-calibrated UV data sets, individual pointing maps, final merged images, source catalogs, and individual source images are being placed in the public domain as soon as they are verified; all of the 1993 data are now available through the NRAO and/or the STScI archive. We conclude with a brief summary of the scientific significance of FIRST, which represents an improvement by a factor of 50 in both angular resolution and sensitivity over the best available large area radio surveys.},

@article{Terashima:2003fv,
  abstract = {The results of Chandra snapshot observations of 11 low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions (LINERs), three low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies, and one H II-LINER transition object are presented. Our sample consists of all the objects with a flat- or inverted-spectrum, compact radio core in the Very Large Array survey of 48 low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) by Nagar and coworkers in 2000. An X-ray nucleus is detected in all galaxies except one, and their X-ray luminosities are in the range 5×1038-8×1041 ergs s-1. The X-ray spectra are generally steeper than expected from thermal bremsstrahlung emission from an advection-dominated accretion flow. The X-ray-to-Halpha luminosity ratios for 11 of 14 objects are in good agreement, with the value characteristic of LLAGNs and more luminous AGNs, and indicate that their optical emission lines are predominantly powered by an LLAGN. For three objects, this ratio is less than expected. Comparing with properties in other wavelengths, we find that these three galaxies are most likely to be heavily obscured AGNs. We use the ratio RX=nuLnu(5 GHz)/LX, where LX is the luminosity in the 2-10 keV band, as a measure of radio loudness. In contrast to the usual definition of radio loudness [Ro=Lnu(5 GHz)/Lnu(B)], RX can be used for heavily obscured (NH>~1023 cm-2, AV>50 mag) nuclei. Further, with the high spatial resolution of Chandra, the nuclear X-ray emission of LLAGNs is often easier to measure than the nuclear optical emission. We investigate the values of RX for LLAGNs, luminous Seyfert galaxies, quasars, and radio galaxies and confirm the suggestion that a large fraction of LLAGNs are radio-loud.},

@article{Cirasuolo:2003zl,
  abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of a sample of radio-detected quasars, obtained by matching together objects from the FIRST survey and the 2dF Quasar Redshift Survey (2dF). The data set consists of 113 sources, spanning a redshift range 0.35 <~z<~ 2.2, with optical magnitudes 18.25 <=bJ<= 20.85 and radio fluxes S1.4GHz>= 1 mJy. These objects exhibit properties such as redshift and colour distribution in full agreement with those derived for the whole quasar population, suggesting that the mechanism(s) controlling the birth and lifetime of quasars are independent of their level of radio emission. The long-debated question of the radio-loud/radio quiet (RL/RQ) dichotomy is then investigated for the combined FIRST-2dF and FIRST-LBQS (Large Bright Quasar Survey) samples, as they present similar selection criteria. We find the fraction of radio detections to increase with magnitude from <~3 per cent at the faintest levels up to ~20 per cent for the brightest sources. The classical RL/RQ dichotomy, in which the distribution of radio-to-optical ratios and/or radio luminosities shows a lack of sources, is ruled out by our analysis. We also find no tight relationship between optical and radio luminosities for sources in the sample considered, a result that tends to exclude the mass of the quasar black hole as the physical quantity determining the level of radio emission.},

@article{Cirasuolo:2003rm,
  abstract = {We present a new approach to tackling the issue of radio loudness in quasars. We constrain a (simple) prescription for the intrinsic distribution of radio-to-optical ratios by comparing properties of Monte Carlo simulated samples with those of observed optically selected quasars. We find strong evidence for a dependence of the radio luminosity on the optical one, even though with a large scatter. The dependence of the fraction of radio-loud quasars on apparent and absolute optical magnitudes results in a selection effect related to the radio and optical limits of current surveys.  The intrinsic distribution of the radio-to-optical ratios shows a peak at R*1.4~ 0.3, with only <~5 per cent of objects being included in a high-R*1.4 tail, which identifies the radio-loud regime. No lack or deficit of sources - but only a steep transition region - is present between the radio-loud and radio-quiet populations at any R*1.4. Briefly, we discuss possible origins for this behaviour (e.g. an absence of jets in radio-quiet sources, a large range of radiative radio efficiency, different lifetimes for the accretion and jet ejection phenomena, etc.).},

  abstract = {We have used the Very Large Array (VLA) FIRST survey and the Automated Plate Measuring Facility (APM) catalog of the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey I (POSS-I) plates as the basis for constructing a new radio-selected sample of optically bright quasars. This is the first radio-selected sample that is competitive in size with current optically selected quasar surveys. Using only two basic criteria, radio-optical positional coincidence and optical morphology, quasars and BL Lac objects can be identified with 60% selection efficiency; the efficiency increases to 70% for objects fainter than 17 mag. We show that a more sophisticated selection scheme can predict with better than 85% reliability which candidates will turn out to be quasars. This paper presents the second installment of the FIRST Bright Quasar Survey (FBQS), with a catalog of 636 quasars distributed over 2682 deg2. The quasar sample is characterized and all spectra are displayed. The FBQS detects both radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars out to redshift z>3. We find a large population of objects of intermediate radio loudness; there is no evidence in our sample for a bimodal distribution of radio characteristics. The sample includes ~29 broad absorption line quasars, both high and low ionization, and a number of new objects with remarkable optical spectra.},

  abstract = {Results on the VLA observations (with 18 arcsec resolution) of all 114 objects from the Palomar Bright Quasar Survey (BQS) are presented, and the relation between the radio luminosity and optical luminosity is discussed. It was found that most of the BQS quasars are 'radio quiet' and have a radio flux density close to that of the optical flux density; however, 15-20 percent of the quasars are 'radio loud' and are much brighter at radio than at optical wavelengths. The radio luminosity function was derived. It is shown that the radio emission from high-red-shift (z greater than 0.5) quasars is dominated by compact components; most quasars with R above 100 have small red shifts.},

@article{Xu:1999ty,
  abstract = {We have generated a sample of 409 active galactic nuclei (AGNs) for which both the radio luminosity at 5 GHz and the line luminosity in [O III] lambda5007 have been measured. The radio luminosity spans a range of 10 orders of magnitude, and the [O III] line luminosity spans a range of 8 orders of magnitude-both considerably larger than the ranges in previous studies. We show that these two quantities are correlated in a similar way for both radio-loud and radio-quiet AGNs. We demonstrate that the observed correlation can be explained in terms of a model in which jets are accelerated and collimated by a vertical magnetic field.},

@article{Bianchi:2013jk,
  abstract = {I show here that the bulk of the dust mass in a galaxy can be equivalently estimated from i) the full spectral energy distribution of dust emission, using the approach of Draine & Li (2007, ApJ, 657, 810) that includes a distribution of dust grains and a range of interstellar radiation field intensities; ii) the emission in the wavelength range 100 mum <= lambda <= 500 mum (covered by the Herschel Space Observatory), by fitting a simpler single-temperature modified blackbody to the data. Recent claims to the contrary should be interpreted as a caveat in the simpler fits to use an absorption cross section which is consistent both in the normalization and in the spectral index beta with that of the full dust model. I also show that the dust mass does not depend significantly on the choice of beta, if both the dust mass and the absorption cross section are derived with the same assumption on beta.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},
