The SPIRE raw data (``Level 0'') were reduced to ``Level 1'' using the standard pipeline contained in the \textit{Herschel Interactive Processing Environment} (HIPE) version 8.0 \citep{Ott:2010rm}. The pipeline performs a host of steps including, but not limited to, glitch removal, electrical crosstalk correction, and brightness conversion, which results in timeline data (brightness vs. time) for each bolometer and each scan.
