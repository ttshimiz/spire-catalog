To determine which sources are unresolved, we first visually separated the entire sample into point-like and extended sources. Each source was also classified as ``Detected'' or ``Undetected'' at each waveband. Then all of the point-like sources' Level 1 data were fit using the \texttt{sourceExtractorTimeline} task within HIPE to measure the best fit Gaussian where one of the free parameters is the size of the source, represented by the FWHM of the Gaussian. A source is then considered unresolved in a waveband if its best fit FWHM is less than 19'', 25", or 36" at 250, 350, or 500 \micron{} respectively, or $\sim$1" bigger than the FWHM reported in the SPIRE DRG. However to avoid combining different flux extraction techniques for a single source, we only used the timeline flux densities if that source was unresolved at all wavebands in which it is visually detected.
